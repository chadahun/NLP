"My family consists of four members: my father, mother, older sister and me, who are office workers. During my school years, I was interested in reading books and continued to read books in a wide range of fields, especially reading classics such as the biography of great men, classics, and Eastern and Western philosophy. As a result, I have acquired the ability to understand and empathize with various human images, excellent reason and logic, while also building up my knowledge of the humanities and trying to imitate great men. Because of these traits, I made friendship with friends who like reading books and who have desirable moral senses and humility, and I studied based on my sincere lifestyle by going to school early in the morning and leaving school after self-study at night, following the example of sincere and honest parents. After reading Lee Ji-sung's ""Dreaming Attic Room,"" I realized that by having a big dream, the criminal can be reborn as a great man and eventually achieve that dream, and this greatly influenced me, so that I have a lifelong dream to live a better society."" ""There is a case in which I was greatly frustrated at the beginning due to my lack of skills in analyzing data allocated during the internship program at the AI research institute OOO, but I eventually achieved the best performance among internships by building strategic competencies and overcoming them. Having the most insufficient data analysis capabilities among interns, I was assigned certain predictive accuracy calculations by seven laggle competitions, but voluntarily challenged larger goals and implemented strategies to systematically grow my capabilities by overachieving work-level overachievement. As a result, I achieved the highest performance and received incentives and full-time offers."", The securities industry majored in business administration hoping to become a financier as it guarantees a stable economic life for its customers with data-based strategies and insights.

"In the summer of the fourth grade, an AI research institute challenged me for an AI engineering internship for two months. Three of the seven laggle competitions were assigned to calculate prediction accuracy within 40%, and four were assigned to calculate prediction accuracy within 100%, but I voluntarily challenged the goal of calculating prediction accuracy within 40% of all seven. I set a goal to derive a solution focusing on competition, which analyzes the DB of global companies using the management major domain. At first, I thought that the possibility of achieving the goal was close to zero because I had the most lack of data analysis experience and AI capabilities among interns. In fact, in the beginning, I was frustrated because I did not know how to use basic open sources such as PANDAs and Sykitruns. So to achieve the final goal, we classified the difficulty of competition from 1 to 7, selected seven competitions including all difficulties, and established a strategy to achieve systematic competency growth and final goal through step-by-step overachievement. As a result of persistent accumulation of competency, I achieved the best performance among interns, receiving incentives and offers for full-time employment. In addition, I am preparing to publish MFE and AutoML research results as papers. Based on this experience, even after joining SK C&C, if I challenge myself with new skills and learning without fear, I will build up the necessary competencies and eventually overcome them."" ""I went to the SW contest in the school and showed my passion to achieve my goal of winning the award despite the limited time due to my lack of web development skills and job preparation. My existing development method was to implement it step by step by step by looking at the textbook. However, with the deadline approaching, the result was a basic level, so I boldly took a new approach. It was to study the optimal library and implementation method necessary for implementing the function by referring to the source code that already implemented the function I wanted. The reason I made a bold attempt was because I wanted to present the joy of winning the award to a team member who trusted and followed me, who was not good enough. However, my friends gave me a negative opinion that they would not understand the difficult codes because they were preparing for employment, and they did not have enough time to invest in development. In order to build up development capabilities, I focused only on web development with my team members for the rest of the days, while completing other studies early by minimizing unnecessary time spent in daily life and increasing the number of study hours a day to 10 hours a week. Seeing this, my friends also gave me a lot of advice. As a result, the team was able to win the award by implementing the initially targeted elementary school education support web app called ""OOO,"" which includes video chat, real-time conversation, and bulletin board functions. I will become an engineer who is also creative in SK C&C."",,,,"
"I was impressed by watching/cleaning movies, respectful people, and practicing values. I don't want to be a sparrow passing by the mill. I want to discover unknown insights from Cheil Worldwide's digital panel data. While studying data analysis, I was interested in customer behavior data. I enjoyed the process of analyzing people's behavior in multiple dimensions and finding meaning. I was naturally interested in the advertising industry, where customer data was collected in real-time and used for decision-making. While spending my first internship at an advertising company, you can feel the data-friendly atmosphere of the advertising industry directly on the spot. In particular, Cheil Worldwide is the most active in implementing the data-driven business among many advertising companies. We secure high-quality data by operating large-scale digital panels centered on the DNA center. I would like to proceed with the project so that meaningful planning can be achieved by analyzing this. I want to create a variable that is close to CDM by processing the existing variable that exists in the digital panel data. I have experience dealing with LPoint's customer log data through a competition. Elaborate targeting of retention members was performed by using the 'traces' variables that accumulated and averaged existing variables based on access behavior. Since Cheil's panel data is collected from various channels, the amount of variables will be significant. I would like to apply various methodologies to find the criteria for customer segmentation by exploring all variables one by one. ""Since childhood, I have considered a clear sense of goal as a virtue. I enjoyed the process of making plans to achieve my goals, and implementing them step by step. It was the secret to having a pleasant time in my school days marked by competition and examination. However, things have changed since I went to college. I was not able to enter the department I wanted, so I was not motivated why I had to study statistics. The reason I recovered my sense of goal was mentoring. Over three years, I have met about 200 high school mentees while working in an educational volunteer club. Ironically, I have looked back on myself while consulting students who are struggling with their grades. Locking myself within the framework of grades and underestimating myself was their common problem. He advised me to ""break the mold and look at myself."" In addition to grades, I also looked for factors that could positively evaluate me. It was a time to enlighten myself. It was an opportunity to reflect on myself, who was trapped within the framework of 'not suitable for aptitude' and did not try to find meaning. The choice I made after enlightenment was a conflict. I entered the Big Data Society with the determination to study data analysis from the beginning. While working at the society for a year, I studied programming, basic statistics, and machine learning. Life in the society became an opportunity to set my goal to become a data analyst. I enjoyed the process of deriving answers that fit the purpose from the numbers of complex matrices. I was also able to learn attitudes toward data from colleagues in various majors such as sound engineering and sociology. Seeing colleagues trying to use data in their respective fields, I became greedy to find such a domain. When I opened my eyes, I abandoned my previous passive attitude. I grew together by sharing the experience beyond studying with the members of the society. After forming a group, I learned deep learning techniques that were not present in the original curriculum and transcribed excellent codes in the calligraphy. I formed a team to experience different kinds of data and participated in six contests. At the same time as being honored, I was able to discover my own taste in data that I wanted to study for the rest of my life. I started an internship at the same time as an academic conference. I wanted to experience the data use field. I worked at an advertising agency to collect basic data. By voluntarily automating work in a programming language, I was able to shorten the time required from 5 days to 3 days. Through the small experience of success, I was able to see the importance of an attitude to be active in work. I also worked for a platform company that runs big data contests because I wanted to deal with them myself and apply algorithms. Before the contest, I devised problems in the contest by analyzing and processing initial data from clients, and after the contest, I reviewed the codes for excellent works. I was able to improve my understanding of data and learn several methodologies. The two internship experiences remain as traces of my passionate and goal-consciousness."","" said the three data law amendments allow me to analyze customer behavior patterns precisely. The Data Act 3 refers to the three laws: the Personal Information Protection Act, the Information and Communication Network Act, and the Credit Information Act. The gist of the amendment is to consider ways to use personal information as data by revising this, but to give companies a sense of responsibility by presenting clear standards. The advantage of the amendment in my opinion is the potential of pseudonymous information. Pseudonym information is data that removes information that can identify individuals such as name, resident registration number, and phone number from personal information. For statistical analysis purposes, pseudonymous information data can be used without the consent of the customer regardless of the purpose. In addition, since the data of different companies can be combined through specialized institutions, different data can be combined and utilized with existing data. It is expected that financial and medical data, which have been difficult to access because it has been treated as sensitive information, will be actively utilized. I think that this sensitive information will also be used in the advertising market. Due to the digitization of customer behavior, the amount of data that individuals produce per day is significant. Various variables are needed to elaborately design personalized services. The customer segment can be subdivided based on sensitive information, thereby enabling more rational targeting. For example, in combination with financial and credit information data, a recommendation service can be devised that takes into account various financial conditions such as the customer's loan status, balance, and credit score. In particular, Cheil expects to create greater synergy by fusion of other data with digital panel data.Data analysts need a higher level of communication skills. As the volume of data increases, I think the importance of collaboration will emerge. In particular, domain knowledge is often required to deal with sensitive information, so collaboration with experts is required. Therefore, communication skills are as important as data analysis capabilities. I think a proven analyst who has successfully performed collaboration processes such as projects and contests is the reason why first planning needs it."",,,,"
"""I want to contribute to innovation with statistical capabilities that I have developed using coding."" The first major class that caught my attention as a freshman was a computer data processing class. Using statistical programs such as R and SAS, I was able to dig into statistical principles more without being distracted by complicated calculations. I had fun realizing the principles through coding, so I studied them with interest and enthusiasm enough to work in the class. I gained confidence from the class, studied Python and VBA additionally by myself, and learned how to use R markdowns and how to implement various codes such as regular expressions, and steadily developed statistical analysis and coding skills. For me, LG CNS is the perfect company to demonstrate my capabilities and develop related skills. I got to know the company through my motivation to work as an intern at the headquarters, and I thought it was a place where I could come up with ideas and analyze them using real data and work with a sense of reward for usefulness. At LG CNS, which plays a key role in developing technologies that are used most closely in daily life, such as transportation cards and Kakao Pay, I would like to participate in gaining meaningful insights and creating innovations through a large amount of data. In particular, I would like to work on the smart factory and smart logistics business promoted by the headquarters. I think this business will lead the 4th industrial era by connecting industries through digital platforms. We will conduct meaningful analysis that helps various industries by using data from companies in various industries that are difficult to access. I would like to participate in the SW Boot Camp and learn the languages such as JAVA and C in depth to get an opportunity to practice with real big data. After joining the company, I will become an expert in the field of smart factories by developing my ability as a data expert by learning IT skills, reflecting intuition in the analysis. I feel proud in the process of deriving meaning from logically designed analysis results, rather than simply processing and inserting data into a set statistical analysis framework. In order to develop my expertise as a data analyst, I learned various methods of accessing data and interpreting results by looking at examples of analysis, and proceeded with the project myself. By comparing the performance of different models in my major class, I have gained experience by making a demand forecasting model using a random forest model and receiving feedback from the professor in Seoul. Last semester, I participated in the panel big data analysis competition held by our school and carried out the project. Using apps and credit card payment data of 115,854 respondents, the analysis was conducted on the subject of consumption patterns of grooming people (male interested in beauty). In the process, we had to create variables that represent the degree of interest in beauty for each respondent. We came up with a method to measure the degree of interest in beauty by assigning the reciprocal of the frequency as the importance to each cosmetic item and scoring it. Through tree model, logistic regression, and correlation analysis, we were able to get cosmetics marketing insights from men and received the second prize. We can see data from a new perspective and analyze it with creativity. ""Confidence in coding developed by challenging various tools."" ""I am passionate about coding tools. I used to voluntarily learn and incorporate other programs based on my R and SAS skills during statistical analysis as well as other activities. When I was working as the vice chairman of the financial association, I taught other students how to find bond prices using Python and how to run Monte Carlo simulations. When I was an intern at an insurance company, I learned the VBA by myself and automated repetitive tasks after seeing that I used Excel for most of my tasks. As such, I have the ability to acquire tools and computer languages for new practical tasks based on the spirit of challenge.""���������������������������������������������������������"""
"I have developed an attitude that not only considers ""converged thinking that appears to be an action,"" but also puts it into action. It was based on the strong encouragement of my parents to 'try anything because it is okay to fail' from an early age. It was a big difference in that I could turn what anyone could think into action. When I was a bachelor's degree, I majored in computer engineering and thought a lot about what value IT technology can create when it converges with other fields. Furthermore, I have actively developed convergent thinking by directly transferring it to project execution. First, I have experience in developing an 'IoT-based facility failure prediction system' in connection with the manufacturing industry with OOO in a graduation project conducted through industry-academia cooperation. I was usually interested in smart factories, so I proposed it first after writing the plan, and among them, I developed my expertise by being in charge of sensor value design, DB design, and construction. Second, in order to revitalize the traditional market, I took a Capstone design course that allows IT projects on the subject of freedom. It was very interesting to try to apply IT technology by finding problems and seeing and feeling in the market. I developed 'IoT-based traffic assistance device' to improve traffic problems in the market, and I was in charge of developing software installed on the device. I will try to make my experience of convergent thinking and professionalism in translating into these actions lead to an active work attitude even in Nautilus efficiency,"""" Embedded Software,"""" Algorithm,"" and Embedded Software"" are two keywords that express the competence that I have developed. While taking a creative engineering design course, I became interested in Embedded Software. Through Mindstorm programming using NXC, I created robots and installed software. It was very interesting to see real robots in action, not the monitor console screen. This interest led to an interest in IoT as I went up to the senior level. Not only programming languages but also network and DB knowledge were necessary, so I took data communication, DB system, and artificial intelligence courses. I have experience in developing pet behavior detection platform and pot monitoring system based on small modules as two representative projects using IoT. Through this project, I was able to gain deep knowledge about Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which are ultra-small PCs. In addition, I judged that knowledge and utilization of 'alternative algorithms' are the most important for programming efficiency. Therefore, until recently, I have taken state-funded education for training algorithm-based Java developers, learned privately through algorithm learning sites, and supplemented my skills. As the two competencies I have developed are essential elements for developing software and solutions that will fit into various machines owned by Nautilus Hyosung, I will quickly adapt to increase technological competitiveness. Strengthen comprehensive self-banking solutions,"""" I applied because I wanted to make a leap to become a comprehensive self-banking solution company that Nautilus Hyosung aims for. Currently, Nautilus Hyosung is experiencing various opportunities and changes due to the emergence of Internet-only banks and the decrease in branches of existing banks. At this point, I was able to see its positive attitude toward R&D by seeing the increase in exports of 'NBS', a self-banking solution, and the development of various solutions to realize unmanned banks. When I was a bachelor's degree, I was interested in embedded software and worked on a number of IoT-related projects. I judged that the Nautilus's effectiveness, which requires the harmony of ATMs and solutions, could be the best of my ability. We will focus on accelerating the smart ATM business further and strengthening our technological prowess to match the increase in non-face-to-face channels. ""Increase and expand business agreements"" As a way to increase the market competitiveness of the business unit, the government should push for the expansion of business agreements with the banking sector and the introduction of AI services in Korea. If additional authorization of Internet-only banks is implemented within this year, the number of non-face-to-face channels will increase further. It is necessary to expand services that can be solved with ATMs and accelerate the spread of smart ATM devices by installing interactive AI services. Overseas, we need to expand our business activities more actively. As our technology is being recognized by expanding the export of 'NBS', a self-banking solution, it is necessary to strengthen our business strategy to find a market that can enter the market.""���,,,,"
"One of the things I wanted to achieve intensely was to enter graduate school and do convergence research. The biggest reason I wanted to do convergence research was that I wanted to do something valuable using my IT knowledge. I majored in in information and communication electronics, but I was tired of simply improving the performance of technology. It is because core technology is included in all products and services, but technology eventually develops for people. Sometimes, when I see services released to show off new technologies, I feel sorry for the idea that users did not consider at all. Although the 4th Industrial Revolution has not been clearly defined yet, it is developing into a hyper-connected, hyper-intelligent society, so it is necessary to understand people from the research stage. Just like studying human brains at Midas IT, I also immersed myself in convergence research by studying HCI, human behavior and user experiences. There are two examples of improving the waiting time for children's hospitals at OO Hospital, which produced good results while conducting convergence research, and curating services at the Gyeonggi Museum. The first was to organize a human+engineer and a humanian team with a lab colleagues and propose cooperation to the hospital by e-mail. It has been a very difficult task that has not been solved for decades, even though many hospitals recognize that waiting time is much longer than the treatment time. It was impossible to increase the number of doctors or reduce the number of people treated per day due to a problem that was directly connected to the hospital's profits. Recognizing the limitation that physical time could not be shortened, I looked at it from a psychological perspective. As I constantly interviewed, empathized, and communicated with nurses, patients, and guardians, I began to see one or two clues to the study, and considering that all patients are children, I was able to develop analog art tools and digital fairy tales that can forget boredom through fun. We designed a scenario and are currently developing a demo so that if children input their own drawings through a scanner, it can become a fairy tale story on the TV in the waiting room. It is too early to say that it was completely successful because it has not yet been commercialized, but I expect it to respond well because it reflected all the feelings felt in the field during the demo development process. The second is the case of launching a smart curating service using the Bluetooth function and beacon of a smartphone when viewing the permanent exhibition at the OOO Museum. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and majors in planning, design, and participated, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team to experience the design process and learn design sensibilities. I was responsible for researching indoor location-based algorithms. Initially, Bluetooth signals were used to implement them, but the accuracy of wireless signals was low indoors for actual commercialization services. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and successfully applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike projects that were simply developed as demonstrations at schools. The final test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can lead to customer loss. It was the most meaningful time because I was able to indirectly experience the process from a company like Midas IT to the creation of a new service, and I could also sympathize with the fact that many people's efforts follow behind it. I think the biggest reason why I was able to solve the problem in the above two cases was the rendezvous between various majors. Due to the nature of the laboratory, humanities, design, and engineering majors were able to achieve outstanding results through constant communication and collaboration. Even though I am an engineer, I was able to communicate with my team members more easily because I have discovered problems while observing people with them and have experienced field interviews. I am proud that my experience of designing every process from problem recognition to solution can help me create values even as a member of Midas IT. Based on the collaboration and convergence capabilities I have acquired over the past two years, I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with Midas IT. I believe that the practical competencies in the web solution technology field are four in the order of importance: collaboration competencies, convergence competencies, problem solving competencies, and professional technology competencies. Among them, I would like to give 88 out of 100 points for my competency (calculation basis: collaboration competency (30%), convergence competency (30%) - 95 points, problem solving competency (20%) - 85 points, professional technology competency (20%) - 70 points, 95*0.3 + 95*0.3 + 85*0.2 + 70*0.2 = 88) Collaboration competency I have been working as an OOOO since March 2016 until now. The biggest reason I feel proud and attached to being a member of OOOO is that I am conducting human-centered research based on technology. The human-friendly HCI field pursued by OOOO is considered an essential study in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as it is in its early stages in Korea. OOOO has the advantage of having the research ability of humanities, design, and engineering majors to design every process from problem recognition to solutions to create the best synergy. As a researcher for OOOO's master's program over the past year, I managed 600 million won in assignment costs alone, and I was able to achieve excellent results in annual evaluation by using it efficiently. In addition, I was able to enjoy the honor of jointly winning the Popularity Award and the Special Award by prototyping a walking aid that corrects my posture at the Medical Hackathon 2016 held at OOOO Hospital. In addition, we made great efforts to develop the department through the launch of application services and patent applications through industry-academia cooperation.Convergence Competency I was able to experience the design process and learn about the design sensibility at OO Design School. It may be ironic that engineering majors study design, but I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to create good products without going through UX design process that recognizes humanities value judgment and emotions rather than technology in the upcoming Fourth Industrial Revolution. With the convergence of development skills learned in the undergraduate Department of Information and Communication Electronics Engineering with research in the HCI and UX fields at the graduate school, we are ready for the upcoming fourth industrial revolution. Currently, even in the laboratory, we are used to constantly creating new things through multidisciplinary convergence research, and we are carrying out the First Mover mission of ICT, emotion, and design convergence technology that draws out social and human communication skills according to the changing demand of the times based on user experience rather than technology-oriented. I saw many students standing in line in the elevator on the way to the problem-solving competency class and looked for ways to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I could play the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce elevator congestion. When I investigated previous studies and cases, there was a case where it was manufactured using a pressure sensor. It was judged that the use of a pressure sensor could cause frequent breakdowns when many people used it, and it was differentiated into a non-contact method and a low unit price infrared sensor in order to use it for a long time without residual failure. An academic small meeting conducted a project to solve the problem. A sensor detected human feet and a scale suitable for each step was outputted through a speaker. Troubleshooting by electric power occurred during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis and it was solved through ground reorganization. It was memorable for a long time that it was installed on campus for 3 days to receive the attention of students and professors, and that it resolved the inconvenience that began with a sense of improvement. Above all, it is an unforgettable memory that the project solved the inconvenience in life. In addition, in the OOO study, I remember getting on the subway line 1 directly, measuring carbon dioxide, and counting the number of passengers in the cabin, one by one. We were able to analyze the correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide and people, and achieve the results of exhibiting at the OOO Demo Session in Germany. I became interested in AI through a professional technology competency webinar, and I have experience in presenting a paper to the Korea OOO Association using IBM Watson API Demo. The thesis topic is ""OOO,"" and we experimented with Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech Demo, which shows a high recognition rate. Recently, I am studying deep learning, one of the fields of artificial intelligence, and I am also studying various classification algorithms through supporting statistics and data mining classes. Using open sources, I created AI Amazon Alexa with Raspberry Pi, microphone, and speaker, and implemented a stock price prediction program. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing an object recognition application demo that learned 1000 objects, and we are reading related papers to find ways to increase the recognition rate. Since June, I have participated in the research project ""Study for enhancement performance of robustness and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indoor location estimation"" to collect and analyze data. As we are currently in the early stages of research, we are looking for related studies, and the ultimate goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through deep learning of wireless signals. Although I have not been able to highly evaluate my professional competence as I have just started studying AI, I will confidently promise that I will be reborn as a talented person who will lead the company in the distant future if we grow together and build up our capabilities at Midas IT."",,,,"
"I thought that we should deepen our knowledge through active practical activities that accurately learn and apply what we have learned. I was in charge of planning and coding at the 2016 OOOO Challenge app development competition organized by OOO last year. As a result of brainstorming as a team of five people, we decided to create an app that provides a service that people with mental problems can easily share their concerns and wrote a plan. As a result, I was able to pass the preliminary round and advance to the finals. From this period on, I was in charge of coding for producing apps and implemented UI/UX and functions. Unfortunately, however, I was eliminated from the finals and the activities were suspended, so I was unable to complete them. Through this competition, I have acquired overall theories and skills in app production, and my project planning methods and ideas have improved a lot. In addition, at the 'IT Hope School with Tmax Soft', I learned the language necessary for website production such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to conduct individual and group projects. While thinking about what kind of homepage I should make for my personal project, I made a self-introduction homepage that briefly introduces me, and in the group project, I made a roulette homepage that helps me select and organize on duty. After producing the homepage, not only did my web production skills improve, but also my presentation skills improved by giving a presentation in front of the CEO and other executives and staff members. Through this experience, I have a lot to learn from failures and have realized that active activities are a good way to develop expertise. ""A person who achieves his or her goals"" I was told by a teacher at the youth training center in front of the school called the ""International OOO Awards."" This program is an international self-growth program that enables you to realize your potential through four activities: physical training, self-development, volunteer work and exploration, and to have life skills that change you, your community and your country. I started at the lowest level in this activity, the Dong (six months). My goal was to build a web page for self-development, build muscles for physical training, organize library books for volunteer activities, and set up the last expedition activity as the main pillar of Baekdudaegan. I could easily finish my self-development and volunteer activities because I had been doing it steadily, but I ran after only the final goal without making any specific plans for physical training and exploration activities. When the teacher saw me like this, he told me that I ran only after the final goal, and that I had no choice but to hate doing activities that I did not like. Having identified the problem, I found and selected my favorite activities and made a detailed plan. For physical training activities, I planned to do exercises by part, such as leg exercise for one day and chest exercise for one day, and for exploration, I planned to climb three mountains for a total of three nights and four days. As a result of this detailed plan and activities, I successfully completed all activities, passed the reward screening, and obtained the head of the Dong. It was never easy to set a goal and put it into action while doing this activity, but I was able to successfully finish it because of my parents and teachers who supported me by my side, and gained confidence in achieving the goal.""""Hit it and pierce it, and it will work if you go through difficulties."""""" In my second year of high school, there was an English presentation competition where I gave a presentation in English about my major. The given time was only 10 days. Since it had to be completed in a short period of time, the key was how to capture the eyes and ears of listeners. For the first five days, I practiced in front of my friends and family for about two days, just like my friends who opened the event, where I selected themes, produced presentation materials, and practiced presentation on the level of reading materials while standing still. However, less than half of the presentation, everyone commented, ""I was less concentrated and nervous."" I almost fell into frustration with the first competition coming up, but I decided to do it on my own soon and decided to do it myself. After watching my presentation on a video, I thought it would be better to proceed with the presentation in a talk method that communicates with listeners rather than a hard one. On the day of the competition, I performed a differentiated stage from the participants who only made arm gestures or stood still and presented. As a result, I was able to successfully finish my presentation without getting nervous on stage, and although it was an incentive award, I received a better evaluation than other teams in terms of presentation. While preparing for the competition, I was pushed out of time and had a hard time in situations where I had to bump into anything, but I was able to develop my creativity, develop the perseverance to manage through difficulties, and learn how not to be nervous in front of many people. ""The driving force behind teamwork is active communication."" When I was a freshman, I participated in a program called OOO, a middleware development company, for about eight months from April to December, to create and provide websites for executives and employees. This program is a mission where four people form a group and implement websites related to a topic based on the web site production techniques learned during one semester. With the expectation that all the members of the group would create a website, they initially presented a lot of ideas and showed their positive attitude. However, as each member demanded more, I couldn't concentrate and started to become lazy in everything. As a result, the conflict worsened because the members of the team had to make each other's way and because they acted selfishly, saying that they should make it their own way. Due to the nature of the project where teamwork is important, a big crisis has come to our group. As a team leader, I invited each member of the team to listen to and sympathize with the upset, pointed out the wrong parts, and broke down the walls of my mind to resolve the conflict one by one. In addition, I decided to create a roulette site where I was in charge of program production, one in planning, one in debugging, and one in design, and choose the role that I could best play.Doing so made the project faster and faster, and the team members showed their positive side as they did in the beginning. Finally, our group completed the project and won the valuable result of being second out of five groups. While working on this project project, I have gained confidence that whatever difficulties arise, I can overcome conflicts and resolve them through communication and consideration.""���,,,"
"""Man Who Doesn't Give Up"" I am interested in business activities of a company, so I majored in business administration multiple times. The difficulty while taking the business administration class was a lack of basic knowledge. In particular, the trade class was most difficult because various knowledge such as terminology, customs clearance, transportation, payment, etc. were required, and in addition, the grades of the semester were evaluated as trade project performance. The project was a personal task of discovering competitive items in Korea and selling them to overseas buyers under the theme of 'Finding Overseas Buyers.' It was not easy for me, which was not familiar with trade, to compete with business students. So I decided to bump into it first. First of all, I had a lot of conversations with a Chinese exchange student who was helping me adjust to life in Korea to get an idea. At that time, the smartphone trend was in full swing in China, and since the Chinese people liked gold, I selected a gold decorated smartphone case as an item. Due to my lack of knowledge and experience in trade, I had continuous consultation with the professor. After seeing my enthusiastic attitude, I introduced him to a professor who was engaged in the trade business, and he introduced me to another acquaintance, so I could get a lot of advice on the project. It was also my first time looking for a company, so I recklessly ran around and visited several companies, and after several failures, I was able to find a company called ""DDPOP"" and get an offer at a reasonable price. Later, with the help of a Chinese friend in Chinese, I was able to export three kinds of products to a company using Alibaba in China. As a result, I succeeded in the project and became the most notable student in this class after the presentation. Through this experience, I learned that I can overcome any unfamiliar field as long as I have the spirit of challenge and the driving force to support it. ""What the Youngest Can Do"" The organization that I feel most affiliated with is the Early Football Association, which has been active for seven years. The reason is that I have been active since the foundation of the soccer association until now, and I only like soccer and meet people every week. The most memorable experience was the separation of teams. Eunpyeong New Town FC has members of various ages from their 20s to 50s. As many diverse people gathered, they had different expectations for the soccer team. Some members wanted to play against talented teams and compete in competitions, while others wanted to play fairly and exercise without injury. Opinions were divided, and eventually, the young members who wanted to win the game withdrew from the soccer team. It was very painful because I relied on them when I was in trouble and could no longer see them with my brothers who have been with me for a long time. I decided that this was a matter of affection and communication, and I didn't want to repeat the same experience again. After much thought about what kind of role I could play as the youngest member of the soccer team, I decided that I could play two roles. First, I started working as vice president by helping the general manager. I volunteered to recruit the opposing team to notify the game on the cafe, and contacted the members. In addition, I led by example to carry operation boards and water before the game starts and clean up the trash after the game. Second, I created a place to communicate. I tried to revitalize the cafe by promoting a picnic where I could play soccer and eat with my family, and posting humor and reviews of the game on the soccer team's cafe every week. The members were proud that the youngest has a great love for the soccer team. Now, we have become a soccer team full of love, sharing each other's updates at cafes and having a meal with family once a month. I think our hearts are connected. I promise to become a new employee who truly communicates and thinks about what can be done for the organization. ""No innovation, No Future"" In-school software engineering lab carried out the national task of 'Rebuilding S/W Architecture'. Despite the successful completion of the research by developing a solution, it is my great pride to improve the solution for better performance and to publish this process as a paper in an international journal. The widely used template-based web application (TWA) method has the advantage of code management through modularization, but there is a problem that data that does not require renewal is transmitted and processed on the server. I developed a solution using the Azax technology and the PJAX framework, and through this, I was able to successfully complete the study. However, while conducting performance tests after developing the solution, I was able to find that the solution using the framework has large capacity and is difficult to use. So, I decided to form a team with one of my colleagues to create a lightweight and convenient solution. I had to develop a solution and live undergraduate life at the same time, so I had to pay a lot of attention to time management such as assignments, team meetings, and test periods. Through the two-month development period and more than 20 improvements, the solution was completed without a framework. Through this, we were able to complete a solution that converts the TWA method into a single-page web application (SPA) method that updates only the parts that are needed. In addition, by organizing this process, we have achieved great results in publishing a paper in the COMPSAC organized by IEEE in 2013. ""No innovation, No Future"" I think there will be no further development without new attempts and challenges. Through constant worries and actions, I will grow into an engineer who provides the highest quality service."",,,,"
"[The Core of Future Technology, IoT] I heard that LG CNS has recently obtained the IOT International Standard Certification 'oneM2M' and CoAP Protocol interworking compatibility certification for the first time in the IT service industry. I first got introduced to the CoAP technology through the undergraduate graduation project and became interested in IOT, so I developed the graduation project using the beacon technology. IOT technology is the center of the future industry and I think it can make human life richer. My dream is to develop technology that people can make more convenient by using less labor through IOT. LG CNS is investing a lot to develop IOT technology, such as smart robots for cleaning server facilities and developing set-top boxes for smart home implementation. I think they are going the same way as me in developing services for people. I want to build my LG WAY at LG CNS, which puts customer value first. I once participated in a project competition organized by the CEST Embedded Research Institute as a team with my friends. The theme is ""Smart Bicycle Cluster Driving Using BLE Beacons,"" which measures the current coordinates of electric bicycles and the distance between the bicycles through GPS and beacon correction algorithms, and displays the bicycle's location on the mobile phone application. Arduino has implemented an automatic speed control function that slows down electric bicycles when the distance between the bicycles is closer than the reference distance and increases their speed when the distance is getting farther. In recognition of the achievements after the completion of the project, I interned at the institute during the winter vacation of the third grade. The institute focused on the ZigBee-based electronic price indicator (ESL) project and supplied it to hypermarkets and department stores. I worked to update the server DB of the ESL program and test bugs, and in the process, I learned more about the structure of the ESL program."" [Building a Perfect Smart Farm System] LG CNS has learned that it plans to complete the smart farm by investing heavily in the Saemangeum foothold by 2022. Agriculture is an inseparable entity in our lives. However, as the number of people engaged in agriculture is decreasing and the labor force is decreasing, I think smart farm technology is essential. I will take over as the ITP of LG CNS and contribute to the establishment of a perfect smart farm system. Furthermore, in 10 years, I will try to stabilize and expand the smart farm system in Saemangeum Reclamation Area to build a vast smart farm like Agreport A7 area in the Netherlands. To this end, we will learn the technologies necessary for smart farm automation, such as automatic temperature control system using IOT technology, water supply system, and cultivation quality analysis system. And we will make LG the leading in the smart farm field by supplementing the automation technology for harvesting and packaging, which is still insufficient technology in terms of customer satisfaction.""���������������,,,,"
"[Game is named] Since I was young, I have always been interested in games, and I have been playing them continuously, to the extent that most famous games in Korea have been played. My parents didn't let me play games, saying they weren't helpful for my soul, and I used to play them secretly all the time. Usually, people consider games to be bad, but some people get energized by them. A game is defined by how the user uses them. I wanted to give people a boost through games because I thought they were a place to live and get people energized, so I applied for game server programming. [Let the World Play with Us!] My favorite phrase from NHN Ent.'s four introductions is 'Let the World Play with Us!' Knowing the fun and joy of games, and having people who know them make games and sharing them with the wider world and greater fun for more people. I have a goal similar to mine that I want to revitalize through games, so I applied because I think just working for NHN Ent. would be a grateful thing. In addition, I think I can grow through the company by encouraging new education, sharing skills, and establishing a welfare system for people. ""My favorite game is Dungeon & Fighter."" Dunpa is an online action RPG game based on a solid worldview and exciting stories. It is based on a dungeon that users farm, and a special content dungeon, a multi-user participate to complete, is held every specific day of the week. The difficulty of dungeon is properly set until a beginner becomes a skilled worker, and along with that, avatar content that users can enjoy is well established. Although Dunpa's final content is 'Luke Reid,' it shows strength in avatar content enough for users to jokingly call it 'look+duck,' and stands out even more because there are many characters to choose from. However, there are many complaints from users because the number of jobs is too large and the recent update does not seem to consider the user, causing complaints from users. In addition, the overall system is based on probability, including the 'hell party's' epic item drop rate to get good equipment, and is evaluated as a 'lucky game'. It is a game that weighs between effort and luck, but it is good to play with pleasure and has a large number of users, so it is appropriate to play together. In particular, the specifications of characters that are important in RPG games are well-formed into several stages, so I can say that it is a good RPG game.""""Pixelcube hopes to play games that are simple, but require brains or quickness. I like those games, too, and I enjoy playing games like Sudoku, Square Nemo, and Janggi. Complex games like RPG and FPS are fun, but I think simple games like this should be well-made and entertaining. Just as the foundation is the most important when building a house, the market for games needs to be well-developed if the basic games are well-organized. It is also good for the market to use such simple games to prevent dementia in an aging modern society. I think it's important to make simple games in many aspects like this, so I hope to join Pixelcube."",,,,"
"In college, I participated in a contest and developed a score recognition program with the goal of winning an award. In college, I participated in a contest and produced a game with the goal of winning an award. The assignment was to provide convenience to beginners or advanced users who wanted to learn by recognizing guitar scores through video processing and making it easier to store and modify. Sometimes, when friends learn how to play the guitar, they forget the exact guitar code after about a year. So, through this APP, they can view their own music anywhere they are on mobile devices. However, despite our efforts, we received a lot of criticism in the final evaluation. The reason was that we wanted to complete the project only with coding technology, but the UI/UX part used by users was not good. So, we found out that we needed to cooperate with people in various fields. So, we proposed to collaborate with a design department that the club had not promoted before. There was also a lot of opposition from colleagues who were burdened with collaboration with other departments. It seemed that there was a fear of recognition because it was a new attempt. However, when I finished the project, I thought it would give everyone a great spirit of challenge. So I first approached the opposing team members and persuaded them by telling them why collaboration is necessary. And I built a teamwork through many conversations. With these actions, I made plans myself and made and pushed forward with detailed schedules. So I had a lot of conversations with the members of the club, and I was able to get positive support from the opposing team members. In the end, I received the Best Teamwork Award at the Samsung SW Competition due to favorable reviews in design and collaboration among team members. From this experience, I was able to see that passion for a goal and collaboration with people in other fields are important when working on a project. Even after joining SK C&C, I will develop a lot of technical skills so that I won't give up."" ""In college, I participated in the energy hackathon, developed the fintech program, engaged in the Imagine Cup, and engaged in the score recognition program to be creative,"""" ""Energy hackathon: Thinking about where to go."" ""I went out to the hackathon and did not give up even when I encountered time limits, but I had the experience of showing passion without giving up. The biggest problem was the short production time when I participated in the hackathon. Usually, when we produce a program, it takes a long time, but we struggled with the production idea in two days. It's because no matter how good an idea comes out, it's a failure if you don't complete it in two days. So, after a lot of thinking with my team members, I decided on the idea. It was to create a Fin Tech APP that could plan electricity use by allowing you to check your electricity usage in advance with a smartphone. However, since a lot of fintech technologies have already been released, the surrounding people gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use it from a user's point of view, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather came up with something that was still difficult and uncomfortable for the blind. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who do not use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the amount of money they have used by voice according to their current power. I made the Android part and let the team members use their respective APIs to make it. I shared the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. At first, I thought it would be difficult, but I didn't give up and tried hard, and it was completed in a short time and received the Energy Hackathon. Although it was a short time, I was able to learn a lot because I came up with an idea that fit the topic and divided the tasks according to the period and won first place. From now on, I will maintain this persistence and try to complete it without giving up despite many difficulties even after joining SK C&C."""", ""Get an OCP"" I took a DB class when I was a third grader. But I was most interested in this class than any other subject. Data base is an important technology that goes into all programs. This is because even a small program needs to build a DB to take information and use it again. So I acquired OCP DBA-10g to gain DB knowledge. I have been studying database faithfully, but I also needed to study other patterns to prepare for OCP. As I developed the POS System, I increased the convenience and safety of users by analyzing User Data and showing it as Chart. I was able to pass the test based on the DB knowledge I gained by creating ADO.NET POS with high safety using Oracle myself. As I engaged in various internship activities, I gained many experiences like MySQL. I think OCP DBA-10g has granted me the qualification to be recognized anywhere in the world, not limited to Korea. If you know a solid DB as an IT expert, it is easy to understand the technology to process information. I am still posting seminars I conducted on YouTube to gain strong expertise and gaining DB knowledge through SK T Academy. I will join SK C&C and sublimate various problems into my expertise."" ""Experience of preparing for a contest with people around me while working as a club in college,"" ""People who know responsibility and act on a team project."" ""Responsibility and cooperation are important. I learned that when I started a club when I was in college. When I first joined an academic club, I was preparing for a contest. But I thought the contest was not about solving problems alone like a school assignment, but about solving problems with my team members.So I thought I should show better performance to my juniors. So, the club held a seminar for 10 juniors every week, and when I was working on the project, I arrived at the appointment earlier than anyone else to prepare for the project. And while it is important to be trusted by others through actions, I think it is also important to be trusted by others with the heart, so I often talked with the club members with the same mindset. In addition, while preparing for the Imagine Cup and the Capstone Design Energy Hackathon, I became the leader of the team, felt responsible for the project, conducted it, and communicated with my team members. As a result, I was able to take the position of the head of education within the club and received the Best Teamwork Award at the Samsung Electronics Competition. These experiences can create rapid organizational convergence and synergy after joining the company."",,,,"
"-While working as a personalized service intern, I built a web service that records and manages it as 'my to-do', a personalized service. There are many TODO services, but now many people make a lot of things to do through job studies, but I tried to solve the inconvenience of not sharing the schedule due to spatial constraints by making a TODO list. And I started with the mind of actually producing it using everything I learned. The project proceeded with a personal project. First of all, I made a statement of demand and thought about the DB structure, and I kept thinking about what I needed. I started making it using Spring Boot, and the DB used MySQL. And I applied the method of using Nested Results for Collection with the Mapper of MyBatis. And for CI, Jenkins made it easier to manage continuously. And I wrote a cleaner code using coding conversion, and I made them test the code of the service sector through UnitTest. And I tried to develop the service sector more safely using transactions. But there were also difficulties that I had while proceeding. Among the input types supported by Chrome, it was a problem when receiving objects directly from Spring using datetime-local. There was no problem when I received Date or Time, but an error occurred when I used datetime-local. When I debugged it in detail, the form of datetime-local was yyy-MM-dd Thh:mm, and special characters entered the middle, so it could not be automatically substituted. So I used Converter to convert the received inputs to Date. On the contrary, when I took them from DB and sent them to JSP, I easily solved them using JSTL. I have previous experience of winning them through hackathon or contests. However, I thought this project was the best project because I thought about the technology and safety and efficiency that I applied to the best practice. Usually, contests only see ideas and execution, but as I was working on this project, I thought about Clean Code. Even if it is implemented, I found out which data structure is appropriate to use for each object and which part has changed and requires understanding of API. Unlike students, in practice, a project is not carried out by one person but by several people. Therefore, I think we need someone who has experience in CI and thinks about algorithms and safe codes. Therefore, I think I can grow in TicketMonster. Even if I join TicketMonster in the future, I will be an applicant who writes while thinking about even a line of code.���������"
"-The field I am most interested in in server development is web server development. This is because programs that communicate with other programs or import information through communication to a server can operate more functions than a single program. Since the most people are active on a platform called the web, I thought that many services could be provided and more services were required in the future. As for my experience in the web server field, while working as an intern, I built a web service that records and manages as a personalized service called 'My to-do'.

"[Developer who fills up if it is not enough and learns if it is not enough] I think that the development and operation job should be based on the knowledge of programming, so that you have the understanding of the system and the knowledge of the field you want to develop. In order to gain knowledge of programming, I took the database design course as I thought that the biggest role of the IT system was to store data and provide the information that users need. In addition, I learned Java, Oracle, JSP, etc. and experienced various projects through the completion of 600 hours of external training called the Big Data Manager course. [Experience of collaborating with people in various fields] While completing external training, I have experience working with people from the same department as well as people from other departments to work on projects and participate in competitions. Among them, when I participated in the DA design contest hosted by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, four people from four departments with different data architecture design experiences and background knowledge formed a team, and there was a problem of frequent disagreement. However, the disagreement allowed me to see the problem from various perspectives and proceeded with the design by making use of each team member's strengths. [Happy : A month and a half trip to Europe] I took a leave of absence from college after finishing my third year and went on a backpacking trip to Europe to earn money on my own. While living in college, I thought that I really wanted to experience something different from other people's, so I decided to go on a backpacking trip to Europe. I convinced my parents that traveling alone was dangerous, and I worked part-time at a construction site in Suwon to save money. After work every day, I made plans by searching for travel information with my tired body, and I left for Paris, France on May 7. Due to my tight travel expenses, I often skipped meals and felt lonely by myself. The difference in language and culture also made the trip feel difficult. It was 'people' that made me overcome all these difficulties. [Sadness : Job Failure in the second half of the year] This may seem like a common thing because it is what most job seekers go through these days, but the saddest thing in my life was failing to get a job in the second half of last year. In the second half of last year, when I was in the second semester of my fourth year of college, I couldn't prepare much for employment due to graduation projects and outside classes. So I didn't have high expectations, and if I can't, I prepared for employment with the thought of doing it next time. However, one by one, I lost confidence as the documents fell and I failed the personality test, and as my friends around me got a job, I became impatient. Also, it was miserable to think that I didn't meet my parents' expectations. However, while preparing for recruitment in the first half of this year, I started studying algorithms and data structure, which I thought was insufficient, and I prepared step by step, and I found promising companies that I didn't know about last year. It was the saddest and least confident period, but rather, it was an opportunity to fill in the deficiencies and broaden my horizons, and I applied to Bartek Networks. If there is a shortage in Bartek Networks, I will become a professional and passionate developer with the mindset of actively filling in."
"I was into games when I was in middle and high school. I played many games, including Star, FIFA, and Sudden, and was one of the top five games on campus. That's how I enjoyed playing games, so I entered the Department of Computer Engineering. As I entered the Department of Computer Engineering, I was attracted to programming while taking seminars and classes. As a program developer, it was rewarding that the code I made could help users, and I made it a profession. In particular, I thought that the development of individual programs by various customer groups such as PCs and mobiles would be diversified, and accordingly, I developed my practical skills through internship and club competitions to gain expertise in program development. #NotFearingFailureAttitudeI formed a team within the university. While I was signing a contract to lead a team to carry out a government project, I was also selected for the project, and I agonized over it. Many of the team members said, ""It's hard to accomplish one task, but it's hard to do two tasks at the same time, so let's give up one."" However, I persuaded each of the team members and planted enthusiasm and motivation, ""Nevertheless, we can do it."" As a result of carrying out these two projects, I was able to receive two excellence awards at the end of the year. #Doing My Best When I first set up a team, I was very troubled because there was no server developer. I took the position of server developer with the responsibility to lead the team as a team leader. I had a hard time building, developing, and managing a server development environment through Linux books and Googling, but it was an opportunity to learn a lot about servers."",""""#If the user conveniently chose the company as a 'business' by leading the team through the code I wrote, I launched a service called '&'.

I think there is more progress if you think positively, want to know, want to learn, and experience courageously even if you fail than if you don't and regret it."""
"IT technology is at the center of the rapidly changing world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future direction depends on the hands of those who deal with IT technology. LG CNS's actions to provide services to diverse customers based on these technologies are also the company that I will be with in the future. I believe that the logical thinking skills through mathematics, problem solving skills, and internship experience at a financial institution are essential experiences in developing a finance solution that LG CNS is leading. Through Python programming experience, I was able to find efficient and simple algorithms to achieve results, and also find appropriate libraries to write applicable codes for other fields. This has firmly established the need for programming and software, which is the biggest reason why I applied to LG CNS. While working as an intern at a global asset management solution company, I participated in the development of fund products that can yield absolute returns based on data from overseas funds. It was also very important to set up sophisticated algorithms because we needed data from all funds in the world to find information, and we had to be competitive under any circumstances. I was able to easily obtain the data by crawling the past 15 years' worth of data using Python, and also visualizing it to represent the trend of 1,890 funds over time. I also applied this code to create a foundation that can be applied to fields such as bonds, real estate, and derivatives. After these efforts, we successfully developed the product and received nearly 10 billion won in investment within two months of its launch. In the process, we were able to develop our work skills through programming.""""The next-generation financial system market, which began with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is approaching our eyes. Based on Internet banks and fintech, the existing financial system is changing, and the role of LG CNS is becoming more important than anything else by introducing blockchain and new security solutions. I am trying to create a financial solution within LG CNS that leads to innovation in the financial business. With my experience in school education and asset management, I gained core knowledge of Banking and Finance, dealt with Big Data while working at an asset management solution company, and was able to provide Information & Analytics to our customers through Real-time Risk Mgmt. In the future, we intend to develop a new platform based on this domain knowledge in the next-generation channel and become a talented person who leads the LG CNS that leads the change in the global market, not a leader in Korea."",,,,"
"While I was reading a C/C++ book after I was discharged from the military, I suddenly came up with the idea of a group chat app. I wanted to develop a program that could provide real services other than a school assignment, so I didn't want to make it to a level that simply functions. But the problem was that I could only do C. But I didn't hesitate to start. When I was developing Android, I wandered around for a long time not knowing why the relay server wasn't connecting, and I had to learn Photoshop and Nine Patches so that the UI could respond to different resolutions. It took me a long time to write a simple query for the DB, and so did designing the communication protocol between the server and the client. Since most of the things I did for the first time, the progress was very slow due to different trials and errors. However, the more I developed it, the faster I developed it, and I didn't have a hard time thinking of making the apps I had imagined. Eventually, after developing steadily for about five months, I was able to complete an app called D-Note. The experience of working day and night at that time became the basis of my ability today, and it was a great help in working on future projects. So now I know that when a problem arises, even if it's a little bit difficult right now, if you try to solve it in the end, you will improve your skills and satisfaction with the amount of time you put into it. This was the foundation of my personality to be proactive in dealing with any issues that arise between developments."" ""This is one of my two things that I was solving now!"" That's what I used to say half-jokingly when I was on the intranet team, when I was asked if my coworkers were not going to bed. That's how passionate and persistent I am that when an issue arises, I can't rest peacefully without solving it. I had this characteristic because I enjoyed the series of processes of trying different ways and eventually finding the cause of the problem and solving it. Rather than just a one-dimensional solution to the problem, I tried to track and solve the issues that were even a little suspicious or open to improvement. So, when I tried to piece together puzzles one by one, analyzing sources one by one, looking for where the problem was, or asking for help from a reference or community, I'd forget to sleep until late at night and get into the problem. As a result, I developed a broader and more solid foundation and ability to cope with exceptions. Those experiences have come together to create who I am today, and have greatly influenced my belief that any problem can be solved with perseverance and effort. I still have that mindset unchanged, and I am confident that I will overcome any obstacles with my passion and perseverance. However, because of the personality of being immersed in one field, I couldn't afford to do other favorite things. I also liked activities such as singing and leisure, but I often just kept thinking, 'I'm going to do what I'm busy now and then.' These days, I am making an effort not only to develop, but also to have a more relaxed personality. This is because I think I can live as a developer for a long time only when I have a healthy mind to support me.""'The closest software to people and Nexon' game are one of the closest software to people. Most people, regardless of age or sex, love games. As one of them, I also love games so much that when I was working on a project at school, I used to make mostly games. I made a snake game for two in my Android class and an airplane game in my openGL class. The game was always well received and the professor liked it. So, whenever I was making simple games, I often thought that I wanted to work in a field related to games. It is because making software that users like is a lot of fun as a developer. So, I thought of Nexon. It is because I have developed the games that I enjoyed the most from the user's point of view. These are the games I played with my childhood, such as Illancia, the Land of the Wind, and the Mabinogi Heroics, and Nexon that developed them is a company that will make software, or games, that will continue to entertain users as it used to be. With Nexon, which has decades of development know-how and publishing skills, I thought that it was a company that I could grow with and apply. 'Not a computer engineering student, but a developer.' I wanted to become a developer. However, theory classes in my second year of college were not enough to satisfy my curiosity. So, I always thought about what I could do now and actively tried to find opportunities. As a result, I was able to get two years of training from another company, challenge ACM-ICPC every winter to evaluate algorithmic performance, and a 700-member intranet management team had more than a year of experience in operation and development. Since I dreamed of becoming a developer, I have worked hard to become a developer, not a computer engineering student. As a result, I believe I have been able to design programs from my user's point of view, take initiative in projects, and play my role as a responsible developer. Now I truly want to move away from being a student and grow into a developer of Nexon.""1. Detailed analysis of asynchronous servers 2. Development of websites with dynamic design elements, rather than static ones, I am largely interested in the above two topics. First, I would like to take a closer look at asynchronous servers. Having only known about traditional synchronous servers, the way the event-based asynchronous server works has been shocking. It works like a multi-thread, while breaking down what needs to be done into pieces and processing them into one thread to solve problems with shared resources. I haven't studied more deeply, but if I have a chance, it's a topic I'd like to study. Second, I'd like to develop a website with dynamic design elements.I've developed promotional sites for other companies in the past, but I've used items such as parallax scrolling and responsive web partly due to limited time and resources. The project ended successfully, but I'm sorry that it was limited, so I'd like to create a dynamic site that will surprise users when I have the opportunity. And I'm hoping to record experiences on these issues well in the near future and do IT technology blogs, lectures, and book publications. That's because I want to show my juniors that experience as I have seen your knowledge over their shoulders on the Internet or in books. It still feels like a long way off, but I'm preparing for that day again."" [CasOnline] ""Because of the nature of FPS games where one person has to kill one person and one person has to kill one death, I think CasOnline has provided an interesting game mode for everyone through zombie mode. I was able to play games happily without paying much attention to the death of either human or zombie characters. So it's easy to bicker with your friends when you play FPS or Daejeon games, but we had fun together with Cas Online. [Ilancia] It's an RPG game that I've enjoyed for a long time with its unique elements of ability that build up skills little by little if you use it often, magic and items that give it a mysterious feeling as it is hard to get, and beautiful BGM. As it becomes Nexon's classic RPG, I still maintain the same image as I did in my childhood, so I can play it with nostalgia. It was a fun game with a very simple but thrilling feeling of manipulation with the same atmosphere as a historical drama [Land of the Wind]. There is no reason, but I always remember that I chose Goguryeo and grew many different jobs. I still remember hunting squirrels as I remembered the land of the wind when I met them in the mountains. It was a game where I was so curious about how they realized it while playing [FIFA Online]. I'm in awe whenever I play a realistic soccer game based on discrete figures expressing the players' abilities and hidden statistics. If I ever join Nexon, I would like to visit the spearhead team and ask them about the structure of FIFA Online. [Mabinogi Heroics match] It was the perfect game for me, who valued manipulation. I played as a Fiona character, and the combination of sound and screen effects made the hit feel great. It was amazing how it delivered a realistic, vivid feeling while asking for relatively low points. The story line from the beginning was also exciting, so I had fun playing it."",,,"
"[Benefit: I gained trust after finishing the organization] ""10/5/5"" is the number of part-time jobs, outside activities, and volunteer activities that I participated in. My face was always on the final photo after the 20 activities were over. I had never quit before the promised work period, and I had never let my team members suffer by dropping out under the pretext of personal circumstances in team project activities. Although the contract period is over this spring, there was a shoe store owner who called, and last winter, there was a junior who sent me a letter of gratitude for actively participating in the discussion club activities. I did my job to the end, and did not mind what others were reluctant to do. Then, I naturally gained the trust of people around me, which remained a great asset for me. ""In fact, it would be natural for a person in society to gain trust in a responsible attitude."" However, I wanted to remind myself that the value of trust will shine greatly in the Nexon Networks game service job. It is because it is a virtue that should be equipped first due to the nature of the work that requires constant communication with customers. [Experience: A salesperson at a department store who developed ""observation""] I worked a short-term part-time job in oral sales for 6 months at a department store. The game industry and the distribution industry are different, but there is a common denominator of customers. Beyond simply selling them, we have predicted and observed customer movement and demand for sales according to the season's specialties. We have also rearranged product DP accordingly and tried to help customers as much as possible for their convenience. I am confident that this has made our customers step closer to each other. Just as we did our best in real-time sales, rather than helping them post-mortem, we will become diligent observers at Nexon Networks. ((=) We prepared in advance the demand for changes in the season through observation, and tried to increase sales through real-time understanding of customer movement. If the management team takes charge of a game as well, I think it is possible to solve the problem as soon as possible through preliminary preparation for the launch of an event or a newly released game, and quick reporting on an issue that explodes in real-time.) [Professional: Problem Analysis - Suggestion for Alternative -> A sense of number and thinking] I thought about how a public administration major would be helpful for the game service job. Due to the nature of my major, I performed tasks that required me to solve social phenomena that became issues from a neutral standpoint as much as possible. I developed an eye for even the smallest issues from a broader perspective by seeing stakeholders who have a single problem. In addition, while taking a statistics lecture, I went out to the field and surveyed the field in person, and calculated objective numbers through the SPSS program. I also acquired basic OA programs and accounting-related certificates to cultivate a sense of number,"" I learned a lot from ""3 beats for mind, communication, thoughtfulness and game service jobs."" I encountered a lot of ""problems and requirements at each level"" that arise when dealing with people of all ages while working part-time and doing outside activities. Whenever that happened, I did my best to help them within my competence and developed a basic Mind for service jobs. In addition, while running a blog, I participated in ""ooooooo festival.ooooo oo city social media red rather than red"" and during that period, I served as a communication channel to give feedback on information and inquiries the other person needed. Lastly, I am meticulous and careful in everything. Currently, I'm working at an accounting firm as a part-time job in due diligence on bonds, but there are always variables and I have to approach them differently in different situations. Whenever that happens, I take notes of changes on A4 paper and come home to edit existing files by word process. In the next task, I'm trying to master it quickly without getting confused while watching it. I decided that I could finish my game service job at Nexon Networks with these three beats combined. [I want to represent the hearts of all users] - The primary goal is that as IT technology advances, the trend shifts from online games to mobile games, and game users' 'one-time consumption tendency' is intensifying. It seems that the number of migratory birds is increasing and there are many people who are silent. Customers who demand complaints through email and community bulletin boards can be resolved. However, the majority of users who are below the tip of the iceberg who are turning their backs on games are even scarier. Couples who have separated from diving often do not know why, so they do not know what to fix. If I join the company in the future, I will become a versatile talent who manages expected threats along with the problems that have surfaced. [For better CRM and game system improvement] - I want to adapt to the secondary goal task to some extent and then continue to develop myself to become a professional. On Facebook, promotional activities of LG Marketing Team and Busan Police Station are being reproduced and spread with FUN elements, making them approach consumers in a friendly manner. This enhances promotional effects and brings a positive brand image. The game industry also has many activities in the IT space as its major targets are many young people in their teens and 30s. I want to study more and more ""instant"" and ""going to be swaggy"" customer care that suits them. [K-GAME Service Expert] - Third goal The final goal is to become K-GAME's service expert. I remember when I was in high school, I was so into Card Rider and prepared for a competition at a PC room with the money for a reading room. At that time, I would have simply pursued joy, but now I have grown into a young man who knows the high added value of the game industry. As an IT powerhouse, I am confident that games are a leading industry that will lead the future more than any other field, and Nexon's games are always leaders. In 20 years, we will grow into a specialist who can comprehensively control the service sector of K-GAME, which will lead the world, and achieve self-realization.I once served as an assistant at the Joseon Education admission briefing session. As the enthusiasm for the entrance examination was high, so was the enthusiasm of the parents. One day, a mother suddenly became angry and asked me to take out her notebooks and writing instruments that she had written down because they fell between the folding chairs in the auditorium. When I looked into why she was suddenly angry, a female employee responded that she had no choice because it was the customer's mistake. An angry customer suddenly came to me and asked me to take it out, asking if I was in charge of you. Although I was a simple sub, I felt like I should take action to make my parents feel better. I tried to take it out on my stomach even though I put my hand in the middle of the chair, but it didn't work. So I found the phone number of the facility management team in the auditorium hall and contacted them, and the facility manager told me that he was coming in about an hour. An hour later, the facility manager arrived and we were able to return the supplies safely through the back door opening. After that, I persuaded him by saying, ""The facility management is not under our jurisdiction, but we apologize for the inconvenience caused."" I was able to succeed in unraveling my parents' feelings by showing them an effort to act in person, not just by words. [Eating with a friend from 2PM?] What help do you need to understand the other person's feelings? I had a great experience to take a step closer. Last winter, I met my middle school classmate by chance at the library. While talking about this and that, I found out that I was preparing for a police officer, and I had a hard time because I went to bed three times. He said that he had eaten alone without using KakaoTalk for a year and a half, so I asked him to eat with me starting tomorrow. Then, I felt lonely and bored, but I thanked him and laughed happily. During the two-month winter vacation, we became good friends who we could always rely on while having lunch at 2 p.m., and my friend got a Kakao message saying that she would buy a meal this fall as she passed the examination only after passing the examination. Through the above two experiences, I learned to understand exactly what was required and to treat customers like family, and I want to show off at Nexon Networks."","" [Relieving friends' betrayal] - I hope only to live a conversation There is a group of five awkward friends who have been together since middle and high school. I started drinking when I was 20, and my friend A lost his mind when he drank, and my friend B was good at mischief. Usually, when we paid together, we all did 1/N, but one day, we drank a lot and B took an additional 10,000 won out of friend A's wallet, saying, ""Didn't you ever not?"" A few days passed after that, and suddenly, friend A left the KakaoTalk room and there was no answer. I was angry that friend C told me the whole story of the incident and he didn't tell me. When I saw the act of losing money, I also didn't pay much attention to it as usual without conveying the fact correctly. Eventually, B and I became dissatisfied with C, who exaggerated the incident and wanted to resolve it quickly with A, who got angry. We met in person and talked about our stories because we couldn't convey a proper explanation of the situation and sincerity over the phone. It was difficult to apologize because we were so close, and it was awkward to make eye contact with each other, but I decided that it was a must-go process. A week later, everyone reconciled again, and now the conflict has not arisen because they have learned more about each other's characteristics since then. The way to overcome this conflict is 1. Confronting each other 2. Conversation. Why would they not understand each other's feelings again this time? If there had been no conflict, there would have been no gathering to plan a summer trip. Conflicts often arise because of the number of people who are in charge of data research without presentation while working on group assignments during school days, and at this time, they confront and talk even if they are uncomfortable for the team's success. It's easy to say, but I think there are many conflicts because everyone is reluctant and doesn't want to do it. I want to become a humane game service manager who can hide far away and run into each other unconditionally without doing mechanical work."""
"I have the experience of creating a 'similar torrent program' as a task for the computer network, which is an undergraduate class. The assignment was to create a 'file transfer program', but the assignment was set on a relative evaluation based on the function and completeness of the program, so I decided to develop a torrent program, not a simple file transfer program. In order to develop the program, it was necessary to learn many things such as Torrent's file distribution principle, understanding file processing, understanding transmission protocols, and threads. Most basically, I studied the file transfer method used by the Torrent program. Torrent divided files into equal-sized pieces, collected each piece through sharing between users, and merged the pieces back into one file. In order to use this method, we learned how to process files by dividing them into equal-sized pieces. In addition, since the program exchanges files between multiple users rather than two users, it acquired the knowledge of multiple threads to exchange files with multiple users at the same time. In addition, I learned various knowledge by creating the program, such as file transfer using Java and understanding the transport protocol. It was a tight time to acquire knowledge and develop a program within the submission deadline, but in the end, I successfully developed a similar torrent program and achieved a good grade of No. 1 on the project. ""[I have to solve the problem] I developed a chat program using the COM port for my undergraduate project. At that time, I was given a code to send packets, but if I used it as it was, the latter part of the message would not be cut off. The code was given as it was, so it didn't affect the task score, but I analyzed the cause to solve this problem. The problem occurred because of the speed difference between SW and HW, and I solved the problem by delaying the transmission of messages to solve it. In the end, I was the only one to solve the problem and get a good grade called A+. As such, I will not miss any minor problems, so that no problems will arise in the future. [Not being detailed] I am not very delicate. This has led me to spend a lot of time debugging due to minor typos or grammar mistakes, and I didn't read assignments carefully, so I developed the program all over again in the past. To overcome this, I have made my own habit. I set a coding method and tried to follow it. Every time I wrote a line, I checked for typos and made sure the grammar was not wrong. In the planning stage, I carefully organized what needed to be developed and tried to reduce time waste as much as possible by designing algorithms in advance. As a result, debugging time was significantly reduced, and I developed a high-quality program through meticulous program design.""""[Dreaming of a Happy Society with Customers] I was fascinated by the corporate mindset of Dongbu Fire & Marine Insurance and applied.""

As a member of Dongbu Fire & Marine Insurance, I will strive to create a happy society with my customers. [綏� 綵�] I think this idiom, which everyone knows is also applied to software development.

I always try to solve them with the thought that even the smallest problem can become a big obstacle someday. Thanks to this, I was the only one who solved a minor problem and won first place in an undergraduate project. [Enjoying life] I try to enjoy life and live a leisurely life.

[User-centered software] Since I was a child, I have fixed the computers of my acquaintances, and most non-majors have felt that I am inexperienced in using them. Therefore, I want to develop software that is easy to use for anyone who is not a major.

I want to make sure that no one knows our IT department exists. [World Travel] I want to travel to all countries in the world.

I am the type to prepare thoroughly so that everything goes smoothly. Everything for the job is prepared in advance, and when you are actually working, you are thoroughly prepared to use what is prepared right away so that there are no disruptions. An information system organization is a department that provides a stable IT environment to other departments. This requires the development of stable systems and quick action and maintenance according to the changing environment.

""In a great program, stability and accuracy are important, but I think it is just as important as user convenience."" Therefore, I think it is the duty of the information system job to provide an IT environment that is easy to handle from the user's point of view. I have tried to develop a program that has an intuitive interface that is easy for anyone to use. During my undergraduate years, I developed a music playback app and chat program that focused on intuitive interface. I received feedback from users of my same type of app and reflected it in the interface development, and after all, my parents, who are not familiar with machines, are also using the app I developed themselves.

In order to solve this problem, I suggested a method of searching by reducing the difference in the range of sequence values through normalization in the preprocessing stage, and the professor recognized the validity of the idea and even wrote a graduation paper. Through this, I gained confidence to see that my ideas actually worked through verification and experimentation.

I used APM (Apache, PHP, MySQL) to build a shopping mall. The implementation contents included membership system (member registration, login, logout, member withdrawal, information modification), manager system (member management and product management), and DB related to products and members. As an intern, I had no web-related experience, so I couldn't understand the web at all, such as how the page works between the server and the client, so I had a lot of difficulties that the big picture was not drawn in the initial planning stage of the project. I learned basic web languages such as PHP and HTML necessary for web development, and learned how the web works through online courses and books. I couldn't understand the non-kinetic characteristics of PHP, so I ended up completing the project successfully through a lot of performance and error. Through this project, I came to understand how the web works, DB, and web language. [Mentoring] When I was an undergraduate, I participated in various mentoring programs as a mentor.Since I was young, I have fixed my acquaintances' computers and felt that many people could not use the services that computers provide properly. Therefore, I thought that it would be good for anyone who is not a non-majors to use computers easily, which led to various mentoring activities during my undergraduate years. I participated as a mentor in various programs such as mentoring younger students in the department, mentoring SCSC (non-majors software) courses, and mentoring foreign students. It was rewarding to think that more people would be able to benefit from computers if I worked as a mentor and let them know my knowledge and develop better software."""
"[My Life's Man-Turn] I served as an Air Force communications officer, and I monitored intrusion and error of the military's internal network in real time, and I always felt responsible. While serving in the military, I received news that major broadcasting companies and financial computer networks had been hit by a cyber terror attack on March 20, 2013. After hearing this news, I realized the importance of security once again, and I thought that if there was a security problem, even high-quality technologies could be useless. Through this opportunity, I made a commitment to become one of the people in charge of security in the Republic of Korea. With this commitment, I eagerly took various courses such as HW, SW, and Network while undergraduate school. Among them, the part that I was fascinated by was Network, which made it easier for us to communicate and enjoy convenient life. I studied more about Network and learned various technologies, and based on these technologies, I applied to AhnLab, which can contribute to security through control. When selecting a company that is another starting point in my life, I think about whether it is a company that can sustainably grow, rather than looking at the current situation. In this regard, AhnLab continues to strive not only for computer security, but also for the security of the latest technologies such as mobile, financial information, and IoT. I am confident that this development of technologies for new things is conclusive evidence that customer satisfaction is a top priority, not just profit-seeking. I thought we could work together toward the common goal of maximizing customer satisfaction. I will be one of the AhnLab members who will help us all live in a freer world by ensuring security in the control field I am in charge of. [AnLab which practices 'we' values] I have considered my colleagues and team importantly and have a big consideration when selecting a company. I applied to AnLab because he practices the 'we' values I pursue directly through a bottom-up method of collecting and discussing opinions from colleagues. When a road was disrupted by heavy rain during the long journey of bicycle land, I have the experience of safely moving to the destination by finding alternatives to meet the schedule with the members. In the summer of 2014, I went on a long journey of about 700 kilometers from Haenam to Seoul for seven nights and eight days via the national highway rather than by bicycle. During the long journey, a heavy downpour caused the road to collapse. As a result, I was unable to safely travel to the accommodations I had reserved, and all the colleagues started to tremble. I spent the day safely with some of the staff, visited the area where I could proceed with the next schedule, and fortunately, I decided to receive accommodation from a nearby cathedral on condition of cleaning up. In addition, other colleagues contacted me in advance, and even a patrol car was recruited so that I could proceed safely with the next schedule. Although I felt heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt lighthearted because I felt that we were able to proceed without anyone getting hurt thanks to all of our efforts. I want to be a member of the AhnLab, where we, rather than one person, join forces to solve the problem."" [Verified Human Resources Developed at AhnLab] I am the first to have the strength of being meticulous and meticulous, which is appropriate for security activities. When I was a college student, I worked on a project with Raspberry Pi in an Internet communication design class. The theme of our team was the 'library seat system'. It is not just an imitation of the current library system, but a led notification function that informs users of the end time of the seat and a web seat management function have been added. At first, I thought that we could draw and synthesize the results for each part, so we performed coding work separately. When I combined the coding I was in charge of with the coding that the other team members brought, I confirmed that there were many errors because the parts were not harmonized. Perhaps due to repeated errors, all of the team members were tired. However, I completed a project as a team leader, divided the connection part of coding into n equal parts for the team's good performance, and analyzed the coding in detail in the parts we were in charge of each other. We analyzed the coding we were in charge of one by one, and organized the contents of errors, so the system was able to complete the project as it worked normally. Through this project, I could feel that I had to carefully check and analyze every 'dot' for IT work. The second is that I have known and done the synergy of teamwork that can maximize work efficiency. In my fourth year of undergraduate, I had the experience of disassembling the door lock with interest in the components of electronic products that I use on a daily basis, and implementing the door lock directly with my classmates to learn more about the MCU that controls the system. Unlike general door locks, the position of the number changes each time a password is entered, so it is configured to strengthen security. The number is indicated as a segment, and a touch panel is trapped on the segment, and touch input is possible. At first, I had no idea how to print numbers on the segment and how to operate the touch panel, so I had to proceed with the project by searching for information one by one. I thought it would be more efficient to divide the project rather than study everything alone at once. Through meetings with team members, each of the topics of interest were assigned, and seminars in the areas of segment afterimage output, touch panel, and circuit diagram were conducted. Through a total of 11 seminars, all team members were able to understand the flow of the project, and finally, the door lock was locked. Cooperation does not necessarily take place when you become one, but it can create synergy if you clarify your role, even if it is in a dispersed state. Finally, the third strength is completion of education and certification for servers and networks.In order to improve my understanding of servers and networks and to practice them, I studied and completed the basic Linux, Windows Server management, and CCNA Network for about six months at an ITBANK private institute. I didn't stop at these training sessions, but opened my foothold as an expert by obtaining an information processor and CCNA certificate. Such strengths such as meticulousness, teamwork, professional education and certification will greatly help AnLab become a company responsible for security not only in Korea but also in the world.""���,,,"
"[Left and right: You can do it] My motto is 'You can do it.' This motto is 'You can do it' when I was in second grade, and I finally got the top spot in the team project in the Digital Logic Design course, which is my first major design course, and it became more deeply rooted in my perception. The process was by no means smooth, but as a team leader, I worked hard without giving up until the end. Usually, the subject of this course was the design of digital alarm clocks, but the task we were given was the design of a hexadecimal calculator. Because the hexadecimal system is a poorly used number system, I had to organize the logic of the calculation before the design, and I couldn't find any reference materials for making the calculator. I also couldn't get help from my seniors, and even if I had designed it my own way, there was no way to know if it was the right design. Eventually, all of the students were hardly able to proceed with the project and had to undergo negative evaluations. When the team members started to give up one by one, I, as the team leader, felt a sense of crisis. I put off my other tasks and devoted myself to the project, devouring it into books and the Internet, putting a lot of effort into it. It was a crude design through constant repetitive learning of basic principles, but I came up with the overall idea and worked together with my team members to share parts to complete the final result. I completed the design through several sleepovers and meetings, and I submitted the final report with a nervous mind. My group's project eventually won first place. After the results were announced, I was able to feel that I have taken a step further by gaining an indescribable sense of accomplishment, confidence in design, as well as a sense of responsibility, leadership, and perseverance. As a team leader, I learned how to inspire my team members, and I was able to unknowingly find myself feeling the responsibility of a leader and striving to accomplish it. Since then, I have felt that no matter how vague the situation comes, if I persevere and find a breakthrough, I can come close to success in anything."" [Thorough Service Spirit] After the university entrance announcement, I worked part-time at a donut store for about a year. Although the location and conditions were not very good, I was trusted by the manager for a year and received the highest urgency, and I realized a lot about the professional spirit of the service industry. At the time, it was my first time looking for a part-time job, and without much thought, I ended up working at a donut store an hour away from my home. Due to the nature of my job, all the part-timers except me were women, and I worked under a kind of territoriality and criticism. At first, I had complaints and thought about quitting, but because the manager was so kind, I held back and worked hard. Since donut stores are also a kind of service business, how to treat people kindly and respond wisely to customers' complaints were required, but more were required when demanding customers came to complain. However, most of the part-timers were 20-year-olds in society, and they were often unable to respond kindly to customers' rude or unfair demands. The store manager paid a lot of attention to word of mouth because it was in the center of numerous apartment complexes, and I couldn't stand by and watch. I quickly learned the task so that I could perform the role of serving customers first, and I suggested it to the part-timers. They would also be stressed when dealing with demanding customers, so if there was a problem with customer service, they would ask me to hand over the service. Since then, I have served a lot of dissatisfied customers and although I could never say it was a good time, I have received a lot of compliments from the manager for his consideration and his own principles. It is because the number of customers has increased, and the reputation of the store has been very good. It has been a rewarding experience for me because I could feel a lot about the spirit of the service industry and I have been treated well by the manager in return for his hard work."",""[Half Middle School Programmer] I have been exposed to computers since I was a child. Soon after, I became proficient in computers enough to take charge of computers in the house, and after gaining momentum, I bought a book when I was in middle school and challenged myself to learn the C language. Since I was a child, I liked to make things using a computer. At the time, my friends used computers to play games and listen to music, but I also used tools to make games using the mouse cursor, icons, or homepages. Then, I suddenly wondered what the source of various programs was, and while looking on the Internet, I learned about language C, which is the basis of programming. The friends around me had no idea of language C, and there was no one around me who could give me advice on language C, so I decided to teach myself recklessly. I decided to choose a recommended book on the Internet, bought a book, and started studying by following the example. However, language C did not feel easy for me as a middle school student. I was only familiar with the GUI, so I was at the level of understanding basic concepts and simple examples, such as simply outputting the results of the DOS screen even when solving examples and exercises, or it was difficult to approach the answer in principle. After finishing a book without direction, I thought about what I could do, and all I had left was 'Hello world'. I felt an unknown challenge and tried to get something by scanning the book again. After all, understanding about half of the book was my limit at the time, but it later became a solid foundation for me. When I went to the electronics department, I was able to get one step ahead of others in the SW field, where everyone was struggling, and I was able to catch both HW and SW."",""[Flipping back] I always have a habit of flipping thoughts once in a while.It's because I've frequently experienced unexpected and far better directions. For example, when I was working on a team project in a digital integrated circuit subject, I scored high in a different way than others. I was usually interested in this field, so I completed the team project much earlier than the deadline. When I finished the result report, the team members were no longer interested, but I thought, ""What if it's not completed as usual?"" Meanwhile, I discovered that my team's and other team's topics could converge. Our team's topic was to output RGB data received through the camera module, and among the other team's topics, to adjust the pixel data through coding and display a picture on the monitor. By combining these two, we came up with the idea of connecting RGB data to the input of VGA Control and outputting the image from the camera to the monitor. As the team had already completed the project, I proposed a collaboration, and the two teams combined the topics to work on a new additional project. Although the difficulty of both topics was so difficult that we were unable to complete the original project due to time and technical constraints, we succeeded in printing out RGB data in color on our monitors. After our team's presentation on the day of the assignment, we announced about additional projects. Because we were the only team that worked on additional projects, not only the students but also the professors were surprised. After the presentation was over, the professor said this is a case in point. In the end, both teams received the highest marks in the project section and completed the course with high grades. This was the most gratifying and meaningful thing that I have achieved by the habit of reversing thoughts in the opinion of the majority.""""[Almighty engineer on the principle of communication and consideration] My most important values are communication and consideration, and my dream is to be an omnipotent engineer who can do anything well. I have always worked hard to achieve these two goals, not only in my studies but also in my life. In order to experience the corporate culture that I have not experienced in person, I have experienced a sense of belonging by working on card inspection and documentation for about a month in the R&D team of Korea Smart Card. I mainly performed frequency and non-destructive inspection and documentation work. In addition, during vacation, I learned how to use the tool and basic knowledge by receiving PCB design training using Cadence's tools. I have tried to develop both hardware and software skills. Through various classes in the curriculum, I have developed my ability to handle MCUs skillfully, not only understand simple codes but also code to code programs, but also learn the roles of each MCU pin or how to use communication functions when necessary to enable various types of application coding. Using this, I also created a graduation work under the theme of 'Home Automation Using Zigbee Communication'. Within the team, I was in charge of designing the overall structure of the work, building a wireless communication network, coding, and circuit design of a control unit. In addition, I was passionate in related subjects and received high grades based on understanding, not memorization. My top priority is consideration and communication. I have always thought that the basis of a smooth human relationship comes from consideration and communication, and I believe that it has a positive effect on everything. Based on these, I would like to contribute a lot to the path to becoming an SK C&C that is second to none in the world by becoming an engineer who promotes innovation and leap forward without falling behind the technological changes that are developing day by day. I am also confident that I will develop a sense of affinity and cooperation to lead a smooth company life, improve efficiency, and work with a mindset appropriate for new employees."",,,,"
"""To become the subject of autonomous driving SW development"" As a company specializing in vehicle infotainment, Hyundai M&Soft is leading the industry with its unrivaled technology, especially in the field of self-driving map solutions. In order to become a developer of self-driving SW based on image recognition, I want to grow by inheriting Hyundai M&Soft's advanced technology and infrastructure. When I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet during my undergraduate years, I thought that deep learning-based image recognition could replace human vision in the future, and I became interested in self-driving SW. In order to study the capabilities necessary for self-driving, such as object recognition, OCR, and sensor processing, I gained practical experience and learned technology. After joining the company, I would like to study the convergence technology using object recognition and sensor processing, and the technology that still has room for improvement, such as OCR technology for more precise recognition. Through this, I will become an expert who contributes to the performance improvement and advancement of SW technology so that I can complete five stages of autonomous driving beyond ADAS,"" said the undergraduate school participated in the ICT competition ""Traditional Image Processing and Computer Vision Knowledge"" and carried out the augmented reality RC car project using Raspberry Pi. I was mainly responsible for object recognition using OpenCV and developing driving evaluation logic. I was not familiar with it because it was my first time to develop object recognition while dealing with hardware including camera modules. To overcome this, I spent as much time as possible to understand the hardware and analyze open sources to understand the technology. We implemented object recognition of lanes, traffic lights, and signs using Hough transform and Contour, and implemented driving evaluation logic by mapping sensor values. I completed the project with the bronze prize in the contest and the silver prize in the academic conference. Understanding the traditional theory of object recognition from the preprocessing process of camera input images enabled me to have faster understanding and flexible implementation ability in deep learning-based development. ""AI modeling technology for performance improvement"" The ability to implement image recognition SW logic is important, but I thought it was also important to understand deep learning and improve AI model performance itself. I participated in a competition to compete for model ranking on a real-time ranking board to increase my AI modeling ability. We performed a classification task using a shopping review image mixed with unbalanced labels and noise and a category text dataset. Since it was difficult to solve the incomplete dataset only by algorithmic approach, we planned to solve the problem step by step by reading various papers, combining the necessary technologies. Over sampling alleviated the data imbalance, and the generalization of noise data was suppressed by the calculation of the label smoothing loss. Since then, we have utilized self-training for the purpose of building a completely refined dataset and improved the performance with the Ensemble technique. By creating a model that improved the baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87, we won second place in the competition and acquired technical capabilities for the performance improvement strategy of deep learning-based recognition models."",""""Vehicle license plate OCR"" ��� In order to gain practical experience during the master's course and background in performance, a video device manufacturing company developed the license plate OCR as freelancer. The project aimed to develop a real-time vehicle license plate OCR that can recognize even changes in illumination or location and install it as a low-power embedded board. OCR logic is largely divided into two parts, which consist of localization for license plate area and registration for text. ��� I was in charge of developing Recognition for my role characters. ��� Derivation and Solution of the problem Due to the limitations of the low-power embedded board, performance degradation occurred when localization, which was implemented in the traditional way, presented noise data as the input value of the Recognition model. By analyzing the input noise, we found out that there are two main types, and we implemented Animal detection for removal. The first is when the entire input data is noise due to a localization error. To solve this problem from the perspective of Classification, noise data were collected, and normal character classes and noise classes were simultaneously learned as one model as learning data. Unlike characters with similar characteristics, it was possible to effectively classify noise inputs with features that were not generalized. The second is when localization is normal, but some of the input data is noise due to a segmentation error. In many cases, when the entire segmentation is shifted to the left or right, it is corrected to a normal value. Therefore, we have implemented to compare the shift calculated data with the predicted data of other frames to find a normal value and derive the noise-removed Inference through Ensemble. ��� As a result, we developed a system with a performance of 0.88 compared to the existing in-house license plate OCR system Accuracy 0.6 and completed the project, and published a KCI paper based on the research contents."",,,,"
"When I was undergraduate, I was interested in artificial intelligence using image recognition technology when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which transcends the recognition rate of human sight. Among them, I thought that the key to lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution was autonomous driving. Mando's autonomous driving technology is moving toward full autonomous driving beyond ADAS by developing recognition, judgment, and control algorithms that combine different data such as sensors and images. Self-driving can be applied not only to automobiles but also to unmanned vehicles such as drones and AGVs. I supported Mando's infinite possibilities in developing autonomous driving with high ripple effects with its outstanding own technology. During my studies, I conducted industry-academia research by utilizing object detection/recognition/tracking, which is a deep learning-based recognition technology, and embedded S/W development capabilities. We have developed the ability to logically approach the attitude of project collaboration and deep learning issues and to implement the platform through the underlying technology. Through this, when the era of the 4th industrial revolution arrives, we will not simply be users who receive autonomous driving services, but developers who lead social values through independent implementation. We created a deep learning model for automatic image classification of ""Automatic Shopping Review Image Classification."" We won second place in the AI RUSH 2020 competition, creating a model that improved the baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87. ""Car license plate recognition algorithm porting on SoC boards"" Algorithm for software operation was transplanted from lightweight embedded boards. Based on the implementation, we published it as a KCI paper. ""Development of ""Car license plate recognition SW"" real-time license plate OCR system was developed. We successfully completed the pre-stage development for the construction of the baseline and signed an extension contract through industry-academia research on campus. The performance improved to 0.88 compared to the in-house LPR system Accuracy 0.6. ""Automatic programming for web applications"" We developed an automatic web application generation platform based on sketch images. It succeeded in TTA certification and patent registration, and published a KCI paper after receiving the Best Paper Award at the Korea Computer Science Conference. ""We developed a VR/AR RC car that sets driving records on the model road of the ""augmented reality RC car using Raspberry Pi."" We won the bronze medal by ranking 7th out of 430 teams in the OOO ICT contest, and we received the silver prize by publishing a thesis at an academic conference.""""Growth towards self-driving development experts"" I will become an expert who provides solution design and implementation for self-driving services with image recognition technology based on deep learning and convergence technology using sensor data. I will grow through two activities after joining the company to achieve my goal. First, I will always research new technologies with an active attitude and take the lead in realizing high-tech skills by using them in practice. I believe that self-driving can only implement flexible technologies in a rapidly changing environment by constantly applying the latest technologies. We will review at least two papers every month, attend seminars related to artificial intelligence from time to time, and apply new technology capabilities to the field. Second, we will create an environment that grows together and create synergy. During my master's course, I presented the project implementation as a thesis and exchanged knowledge to grow. Even after joining the company, I will always think about improvements in the project with my team and create an environment to exchange acquired knowledge through academic meetings. Through this, we will contribute to achieving results with higher technological prowess. I am sure that the two activities that I will practice after joining the company will be important foundations for achieving my goals. Along with Mando, I will become an expert who researches advanced technologies and leads the development of autonomous driving. ""Automatic classification of shopping review images, 20.07.13~20.08.27"" As an intern at OOO, I performed multimodal classification using CNN and category metadata with shopping review image database mixed with unbalanced label and noise data. To create a noise robust model, we applied Label smoothing and built a clean dataset using Self-training. For multimodal learning, we designed an embedded layer that can learn information of metadata. In the final stage, we built several models with different network structures and applied Stacking ensemble to increase the performance. Based on the thesis, we were able to implement the technology and develop our ability to solve problems. """"Porting vehicle license plate recognition algorithm on SoC boards, 19.06.24~20.02.23"""" This is an industry-academia study with the support of OOOOOOO. With the aim of installing license plate recognition software on the low-power embedded board Hi3519A, we have transplanted a system implemented with Python language and Keras framework into C language and Caffe framework. For embedded boards that require less computation and efficient structure, the network has been redesigned based on lightweight deep learning algorithms. To prevent noise-induced performance degradation among real-time input data, Self-Training, one of the Semi-Supervisored Learning technologies, was used to implement anomaly detection and increase accuracy to suppress noise input. We have developed the ability to implement programs to be commercialized while coping with detailed requirements and bugs."""" Vehicle license plate recognition SW development, 18.12.26~19.06.25"" We developed the license plate OCR system while working as a freelance developer at OOO, a video device manufacturing company. Regarding vehicle license plate text recognition, we focused on internalizing technologies that can be recognized in real time regardless of external matters such as location, time, and climate conditions. Localization data pre-processing and object recognition for OCR were implemented, and object tracking was implemented for distinguishing multiple license plate instances.In order to efficiently collect license plate data, we implemented a system that uses the Inference result of Confidence score that satisfies the threshold value among the results obtained from the RTSP image of road CCTV as learning data. The research alone was able to develop practical skills that were difficult to learn. ""Autoprogramming for web applications, 17.09.01~18.05.31"" Intelligent automatic programming technology was studied through industry-academic research with the support of OOOOO. The purpose was to provide high-quality web services through model-based code automatic generation technology, to eliminate errors by direct coding of developers, and to secure automated technology of test and debugging. To recognize the layout of a sketched web UI, we implemented a search algorithm by implementing pre-processing such as Edge Merge and Slope Filtering using Hough transform. We implemented an algorithm that detects web objects in the layout using deep learning-based object detection and automatically generates HTML codes that match the classified results. It was a good experience to proactively develop the overall deep learning platform backend. """"ARC cars using Raspberry Pi, 17.03.02~17.11.24"""" The project was carried out with an entrepreneurial mentor with the support of the OOO ICT contest organized by OOOOOOO. In order to operate the algorithm in embedded form, we built a server that can communicate with various sensors inside mobile and RC cars. We implemented object detection to recognize signs, traffic lights, and lanes, and an algorithm to evaluate driving scores using recognized values and various sensor data. It became an opportunity to learn the basics and hardware knowledge of traditional computer vision."",,,,"
"First of all, I became interested in Hyundai M&Soft because I have often heard the news that it is making generous investments in developing mobility connectivity and various mobility infotainment technologies as well as existing navigation solutions. Among them, I applied for the embedded S/W quality evaluation job because I thought it was consistent with the activities I had done so far. I have produced various results by winning the gold prize in the autonomous robot competition using the embedded system and the Defense Acquisition Program Administration Award in the thesis registration and start-up competition using bio-signals. As I mainly developed embedded SW, I learned that SW quality is important for sustainable growth. Therefore, I was able to encounter the theory by obtaining related certificates, and after joining the company, I would like to produce results that encompass engineering background knowledge and SW evaluation knowledge for the development and evaluation of embedded SW that ultimately satisfies customers. ""I have been mainly developing until I was interested in the quality evaluation of embedded SW, and I realized that the quality of SW is important for sustainable SW development based on this knowledge. Through this, in the second half of 2020, I gained expertise to perform my application job while making efforts to obtain related certificates. Previously, I mainly designed bio-signal systems through my experience as a researcher and intern in the lab for about a year in the medical engineering lab. Naturally, designing a SW-centered system was not easy as a mechanical engineering student. However, it was something I really wanted to do, and I knew that the future food would be a data analysis SW system, so I kept making the following efforts. First, I tried to get to know each other. In the undergraduate course, SW is only the basis of Matlab and C language, and it is also simple expression and number calculation. With the desire to take a leap forward, I went to the medical engineering lab in person to prepare for the test, and that's how I started my undergraduate research life. While learning a SW program separately from the professor, I analyzed and organized bio-signal data, assisted PhD students, and participated in numerous studies. When I was tired and lazy, I challenged myself to continue making steady efforts. Through the deep learning SW training held at OOOO in Korea, OOOO deep learning training, OOOO system training seminar, and participation in future connected car expert curriculum, I traveled around Busan, Seoul, Yeosu, and Gyeonggi-do during the semester to deal with various SWs. Based on the above efforts, I became an expert in preparing for a start-up with wearable device design along with one paper registration. Based on this SW engineering knowledge, I acquired a certificate related to SW quality evaluation and learned how to constantly strive to catch up even in the first field. Experience in testing and analyzing bio-signal data while interning at OOOO. The challenge was to develop a high level of bio-signal data measurement process and secure reliability. At first, I chose a green light source that everyone uses without thinking that errors could occur due to various environments, and I had never experienced errors due to motion noise, so I planned the test in a transmissive form. The results of the first experiment were also disastrous, and through undergraduate classes and thesis studies, we solved the technical problem by using red light rather than green light, evaluating it as a reflective type rather than a transmissive type, and adjusting the sampling rate considering the aliasing phenomenon. Considering the separation caused by movement in the sleep state and the resulting depth of light penetration, we chose a more rugged but stable RED light. In addition, the reason for changing the evaluation procedure to a reflective device was to minimize errors in motion noise. The above procedure was applied because it was predicted that the reliability of the measurement would be low because the gyro sensor was not used as a separate motion noise control filter. Finally, while learning the analysis know-how to minimize the aliasing phenomenon that occurs at a specific frequency through the adjustment of the sampling rate, we were able to obtain a meaningful value by acquiring RAW Data used in the project well."",,,,"
"Books influenced me a lot in the process of growth in forming a perspective on life and a personality. I continued to read various books on a wide range of subjects, and I was particularly interested in classical novels and Eastern and Western philosophy to explore them deeply. I was able to encounter the outstanding logic and reason of Greek philosophers through Western philosophies such as ""Crime and Punishment"" to understand and sympathize with various human images that I had not experienced, ""The Analects of Confucius"" to constantly learn, reflect on, and grow in a given environment, and ""Socrates' excuse."" As a result, I was able to understand the meaning of difficult documents by acquiring not only the attitude toward life but also the understanding and reading of language as I grew up with books, so I was able to easily grasp the meaning of difficult documents. I worked on many team projects at university, and was evaluated as a leading person by leading the team to success by always being the leader or presenter of the team. I think all of these achievements are the result of the humility, relationship-oriented lifestyle, and language proficiency that I gained through books during my past growth process, so my growth process was a period of time to lay the foundation for personality and attitude. Humanities literacy and the mindset to follow great men became the basis for leading myself to dream for society, including myself, in preparation for entering university. The person who had the greatest influence to have lifelong dreams is writer Lee Ji-sung. After watching his ""Dreaming Attic,"" I realized that by having a big dream, I was able to become a great man and eventually achieve that dream, so I was able to enter university with motivation. In addition, I developed life-essential apps as a software engineer and passionately challenged various SW field projects, which made me progress many times. I was selected as a software scholarship student and worked as an exchange student at OOO. In the process of working on more than 20 projects by directly applying the latest SW technologies, I gained knowledge of new SW technologies, English-based communication and teamwork, and especially the know-how to achieve project goals within a limited time. In the OOO SW competition finals, the first educational web app called ""OOOOOOOOO"" has been planned through a survey of elementary school teachers to complement the limitations of e-Learning Center and Clasting, which are elementary school education platforms, in the era of non-contact, and has been producing as a team project since the end of August. In addition, we are developing a web full stack that applies the Agile process and clean code, software architecture and DevOps in the OOO industry and capstone project, and realizing our dream to become a developer to provide optimal IT solutions to our customers. We derived management big data analysis solutions from global companies such as Amazon and Walmart, and studied meta feature extraction and AutoML at AI Research Institute Securayer. We are preparing a paper to study data analysis and visualization implementation capabilities in various domains, gain experience in field work, and study our own AutoML implementation through meta feature extraction. ""I was responsible for researching AI Research Institute Securayer to write a paper related to meta feature extraction technology. In the process, we also investigated in detail the technology that creates another AI with AI, called ""Automatic Machine Learning,"" which is based on the meta feature. I think this issue is important in that it accelerates the development of AI technology and increases the importance of domain knowledge in the future AI industry. The autoML technology derives the optimal AI algorithm based on the performance comparison of domain data from various fields learned and existing AI algorithm solutions for them. This is having a significant impact on the direction of the AI industry as it can replace some of the tasks of AI and data analysis experts. I think that Samsung SDS's Brightics AI can be further advanced by applying this AutoML technology, and in particular, SW and domain convergence talents are needed for the efficient and effective development of Analytics Intelligence, which leads to enterprise-optimized enterprise solutions. This is because SW and domain experts can teach AI the domain knowledge they have accumulated more efficiently and effectively. In the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, Samsung SDS is focusing on enterprise solutions and five core technologies ��� AI, blockchain, cloud, big data analysis, and security ��� and AI is at the center. Considering that AI and IT companies' development patterns are proportional, Samsung SDS should have the best in-house autoML technology. And this autoML technology can maximize the value of the company while meeting the needs of various customers by deriving solutions across various domain fields. And the right person to learn domain knowledge from autoML is SW and domain convergence talents, so we should focus on nurturing and recruiting them."""" I applied to Samsung SDS because I can contribute to the development of Samsung SDS's corporate business support as a developer of MIS-based IT solutions. After grasping the target company's foundational MIS, especially ERP, and management and CRM, I am building up my capabilities to provide optimal AI and SW solutions for scientific and intelligentization of customer business by applying the optimal SW architecture and technology. Through the research and research of meta feature extraction technology for AutoML and the derivation of management big data analysis solutions at AI research institute Securayer, we have gained data analysis and visualization capability, and are preparing MFE and AutoML implementation papers. In addition, we are developing a web full stack in an industry project linked to LG CNS, a capstone project, and a team project that applies agile processes and clean codes, software architecture and DevOps used in the field at the Da Vinci SW Competition at Chung-Ang University.In conclusion, I applied because I was confident that I could contribute to Samsung SDS based on my management and SW expertise. I will provide optimal IT and AI solutions to companies at Samsung SDS. Regarding the development of enterprise solutions and IT technology solutions such as AI, cloud, and blockchain, I would like to share big data-based innovation and grow with the company."",,,,"
"As a management-based IT solution developer at KT DS, I will contribute to the development of Digital transformation, AICentro DL Studio, financial IT, and business solution support services.

Specifically, we have planned and are currently working on the first educational support web app that complements the limitations of 'e-learning center' and 'clasting' in the OOO SW competition finals through a survey of elementary school teachers. Using Node and React, users will sign up and log in to participate in real-time chat rooms, make announcements, open small chat rooms, use of whispering function, and add video chat function afterward. In addition, I have experience leading the Capstone Project for six months at EPITH Paris. Based on my initial business plan of identifying users' mental state based on their heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly, I gradually embodied the functions and design of the app with my team members. In addition, the team shared the vision that it would reduce users' daily stress, and faithfully performed each other's parts for six months. I was in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, heart rate analysis algorithm search and development, and completed an initial application called MusicMe, and was selected as A grade in recognition of the novelty of ideas and sincere process performance."",,,,"
"The ""Professional Communicator who also communicates with user logs"" IT job is to develop information systems such as BGF Retail's POS system so that merchants can efficiently perform sales operations. Without a computerized information system such as inventory management, ordering, and calculation at convenience stores, all tasks will be disrupted. IT personnel should always strive to improve user convenience beyond simply preventing errors from appearing in the system. To do this, it is necessary to be able to constantly communicate with users, understand their work, identify needs, and come up with improvement plans. To realize this, the attitude of communication that has been experienced while operating the system will be a great strength in performing tasks. There were time and physical limitations to always communicate directly with users while operating the system, so I developed a habit of checking the logs. While checking the logs, I found that the user repeated the same tasks at the same time. Accordingly, we conducted an interview and agreed on the user's inconvenience and suggested an RPA service that could solve it. By automating the work, we were able to improve customer discomfort and generate company profits. If we listen to not only direct communication but also indirect communication, we will contribute to the organization by discovering the needs of system users and resolving inconveniences. In the IT field, new technologies such as IoT, big data, and AI are constantly pouring out more than other fields. Just as CU opened a hybrid convenience store, we will constantly acquire and apply new technologies to create a store where people and technologies come together to put the convenience of customers and franchisees first by combining new technologies,"" and ""If we fail to communicate, we will go to the mountains."" I think the most important competency in achieving the common goal is communication skills. This is because a group cannot communicate well, just as there are many workers going to the mountains, just as a group goes to the mountains. As a grade representative, I believe communication is the center of collaboration, and I have experience in drawing consensus from student council groups. While planning the festival, even though we had a common goal of an unforgettable festival, we had difficulties due to differences in opinions of each department. The general affairs department failed to reach a consensus by raising profitability, the planning department by raising student interest, and the chairman and vice chairman by raising external aspects, and asked each department to present guidelines after sufficient meetings to resolve these issues. As a result of continuing to mediate opinions to hold events that are satisfactory to all, we were able to reach a consensus that students could be satisfied with within the budget. I think the reason why we have different opinions even within the same organization is that each person has different responsibilities. I will become an IT expert who develops, operates, and maintains the best services in BGF Retail by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions. ""Winning the prize through unique presentation method through role play"" and ""RFID Technology"" were given a silver award for differentiated presentation method that introduced role play in technical report preparation and presentation competitions. In preparing for the presentation, I thought it would be difficult to understand after hearing only the presentation about the first technology I encountered, so I thought a lot about the presentation method using role play. After much thought, I suggested the presentation method using role play to my team members as a part of the parts needed for technology. However, the team members refused due to the fear of the presentation and the fact that it would take a long time to prepare. Therefore, I persuaded them by presenting the presentation in front of the team members once as a role play and once as a conventional presentation method, and I was able to get their consent. As a result, I was able to effectively understand the technology called RFID through my own differentiated presentation method. In addition, I was selected as a class representative and received a silver award by participating in a presentation competition hosted by the College of Engineering. Through these experiences, I was able to experience the importance of trying a creative approach and having a discriminatory competitiveness that is different from others. In addition, no matter what I do afterwards, I am trying to get better results by finding new ways without having any stereotypes."" ""Using mobile apps is an advantage, too many apps are a disadvantage,"" the CU convenience store app provides a reservation service. Recently, various convenience store foods have been introduced through the Pyeonstorang program, and products released through the Pyeonstorang program have the advantage of being easy to purchase through the app's reservation service. From the customer's point of view, the fact that they can purchase hot-talked-about products like the Honey Butter Chip fiasco has come as a big attraction in that they can buy them through the app without going in vain. On the other hand, I think it's a pity that there are too many CU-related apps such as Pocket CU, CU Convenience Store Delivery, and CU By-Self. This is because they would think that if they had to download three convenience store-related apps and use them even though they are not apps that they always use like messenger or SNS, they would unnecessarily use too much data and capacity. ""Focus on product R&D by reducing the cost of low value-added work"" Convenience stores usually use places that are close to them when they need something. However, in order to purchase hot-talked-about products such as Pyeonstorang products, they look for places that sell them, even if they are far away. I think developing and releasing a lot of hot-talked-about products like this is a way to increase the competitiveness of CU convenience stores. In order to reduce the cost of low value-added work and focus on high value-added work such as product R&D, it would be better to consider automating work through RPA instead of low value-added work. In addition, product research and development requires a lot of money to be invested. To cover these costs, IT jobs will need to consider introducing a cloud environment to reduce the cost of servers."",,,,"
"""Activity and the spirit of challenge nurtured in other countries."" When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I entered a local school in the U.S. without any English proficiency. There were only Asians in the school, and no one came forward to help. Everything, such as on-campus competitions and events, was a challenge, and I adapted by actively talking to my teachers and friends in poor English. This year's activeness that I have gained from other countries has allowed me not to be afraid of new challenges. People around me say that I am versatile, because I challenged myself even if I was not in a good field rather than because I was excellent at it. When there was no one who could do Photoshop or video editing, I took charge of it and learned video lectures, and based on my R skills, I learned various programs such as Python and VBA whenever I needed. Even though I was not a related major, I was the vice chairman of the Financial Engineering Association and actively showed interest in finance enough to achieve curriculum reform. This activeness can sometimes be a disadvantage. As there are many things I want to try, I sometimes cannot finish what I started because I am greedy for a limited amount of time. I took the time to go to China for a month to learn Chinese, but I almost couldn't take the English certification exam that I had planned. Taking this opportunity, I am practicing how to prioritize work and manage time leisurely and systematically so that I can carry out important work step by step. ""Leader who embraces everyone"" My experience in the U.S. became an asset, but I couldn't forget the feeling of being left alone at that time. I felt the big difference that a single helping hand made, so I developed a sense of value to be the one who gave that hand. I felt the duty to create an atmosphere in which everyone can participate without any alienated members, so I self-proclaimed myself as a mood maker and made efforts for unity. People around me recognized this and I was selected as a vice chairman by performing clubs and financial engineering societies, so I was able to create an inclusive atmosphere. ��� 2-1 Please explain what you think are the core competencies required to perform the job you applied for and why. ""Transmission and agility for business"" I want to become an asset management expert at Shinhan Bank. I think the key to this is the ability to transmit and quickness accompanied by expertise. When recommending a product or portfolio to a customer, you must be able to effectively convey the reason along with the evidence. This is because the customer must be able to intuitively understand it so that they can trust the asset management. Among the reviews on Robo-Advisor, I saw many opinions that the resulting algorithm was not reliable due to the lack of explanation. As such, it will become more important to easily explain and analyze customers' tendencies, markets, and past cases with manpower that cannot be digitally replaced. You also need the agility to respond to various requirements because you face a wide variety of customers. When faced with an unexpected situation, you should persuade your customers calmly rather than panicking. Work agility in acquiring and applying new knowledge and methods immediately is also important in accordance with the rapidly changing financial market. ��� 2-2. Please describe in detail what kind of effort you have made to acquire that capability. ""To become an omnipotent executive,"" I tried to acquire all kinds of capabilities, including expertise, delivery, and agility. Based on what I learned in the financial risk class, I worked as the vice chairman of the Financial Engineering Association and learned financial theory. Through lecture-style sessions, I taught the concepts to the academic members, and since many other students are new to finance, I have developed the ability to communicate easily by comparing credit derivatives to insurance. I studied and deepened my knowledge to obtain a certificate of asset management, and as an intern in the risk management department, I monitored risks related to the company's assets and applied what I learned to practice to develop the qualifications of financial experts. As I have also developed analytical capabilities with statistical projects, I can understand the process and results of data-based corporate credit ratings or asset management, and analyze customer tendencies based on past data to implement more effective asset management. In addition, I have worked part-time jobs for many years to satisfy the needs of customers of various nationalities, and I have also developed quickness and customer-oriented spirit. ��� 2-3 Please describe in detail what kind of dream you want to pursue in the field you applied for and why you want to achieve that dream at Shinhan Bank. ""From increasing the efficiency of WM to popularization"" ""I want to become an expert in the most efficient asset management by analyzing the characteristics of customers through more detailed clustering by demonstrating financial knowledge and statistical capabilities. I felt the importance of grouping through customer data analysis experience, and I will lead the WM market by establishing a more sophisticated system, going beyond the existing WM method, which is subdivided into three stages of Shinhan Bank. For asset management, I will realize Shinhan's 'knowing customers right away' spirit, which values accurately identifying needs by analyzing customers from various fields first. Another reason why Shinhan wants to achieve its dream is that it can utilize the integrated data of all affiliates in various ways with the 'One Shinhan' strategy. After developing expertise, we will study to supplement it by presenting variables that reflect reality more precisely in the robo-advisor algorithm. I want to contribute to the popularization of asset management services by developing AI as a means of assisting manpower, increasing its usability and accessibility."","""" Securing older customers of FinTech"" The financial industry is constantly changing with the development of FinTech. Just as Shinhan Bank introduced the data-based corporate evaluation process using the CSS model, it can be approached not only in terms of work, but also in a more convenient service for customers. However, this change did not reach the older people, as the mobile banking utilization rate over 60s was only 5.5%. The spread of digital banking among the elderly is an opportunity to not only achieve the social purpose of resolving financial alienation, but also to accumulate data in banks and establish a platform to deposit customers in various fields such as the retirement market.Shinhan Bank has also been operating a separate window for senior citizens since 2016, and has been targeting senior citizens through SOL Senior, etc., but since there are fundamental barriers to entry such as distrust of machines, a more multidimensional and active target is needed. We conducted an analysis on the use of apps based on panel data, and fintech apps used the most among households of 4-5 years old or older. They interpreted that there is a higher probability of using them with the help of children or grandchildren than with voluntary use. One way is to provide family-level benefits so that families can encourage them to use them. We also need to devise various creative solutions, such as providing benefits that are more realistic as a refund rather than a discount, taking advantage of the characteristics of the elderly who are sensitive to even a small amount of money. ""Achieving 250,000 views through collaboration."" Last semester, I made a dance video to promote the club with four members as the vice chairman of a performance club. However, the process was not smooth. The roles were divided by drawing lots of people who wanted to take charge of overlapping parts, but the team members who could not take the desired part showed their motivation as they did not attend the practice. I held an idea meeting to re-engage my team members' voluntary participation. It was to remind them of a common goal while setting up specific strategies for topicality. We shared various ideas at the meeting. One friend suggested recruiting a separate filming team from the school community, and the other suggested filming on the rival university campus considering that the university competition was a hot topic at the time. I analyzed famous dance video channels, and I saw the comment window activated when the same person appeared steadily, and based on this, I came up with the idea of taking several videos and uploading them consecutively. As I shared my opinions, I felt close to my goal. In addition, there was an atmosphere in which we recognized the credit of each other's opinions, so we were able to redistribute our dance by yielding our part. The team members regained their motivation and invited a filming team to film the video. After that, as a result of posting promotions on the community and dance-related sites through division, the video reached 250,000 views in one month. It was an achievement through teamwork,,,,"
"I feel proud of the process of seeing the meaning of the analysis results based on ideas, not simply processing and inserting data into a set analysis frame. It is not an exaggeration to say that the whole nation uses telecommunication services, and it will continue to expand in the future. I would like to feel the joy of collaborating with colleagues who are experts in different fields to produce meaningful results using the vast amount of customer data that LG U+ has accumulated over the years. In order to develop my expertise as a data analyst, I conducted projects myself by learning various ways to access data and interpret the results by looking at examples of analysis in my major class. One of them was a project that I carried out last semester when I participated in a panel big data analysis competition held by our school. The analysis was conducted under the theme of consumption patterns of grooming people (men interested in beauty) using app usage and card payment data of 115,854 respondents. In order to create a variable that quantifies the degree of interest in beauty, we have devised a new method that weights the item as the reciprocal of the usage rate among the total respondents of each cosmetic item, so that the more rarely used cosmetics are of greater importance. Through the R tree model, logistic regression, and correlation analysis, I was able to get cosmetics marketing insights for male targets, and I received the Excellence Award. In addition, I gained experience by making OOO prediction models and receiving feedback from professors. I learned coding with interest and enthusiasm as I worked in my major class learning R and SAS. In statistical analysis, I learned other programs based on my R skills and applied coding when I was engaged in other activities as well. When I was working as the vice chairman of a financial association, I added sessions such as finding bond prices in Python and replaying simulations to teach other students. When I was an intern at an insurance company, I saw that I used Excel for most of my work, and I learned VBA by myself to automate repetitive work, thereby improving my coding skills steadily."" In the second year of elementary school, I moved to the U.S. without being able to speak English at all and entered a local school. It was a difficult situation to face discrimination, but I was able to learn English in a short period of time by talking to my friends who were marginalized by short English. The childhood experience of making English my strength by taking advantage of the urgency of a situation that could have left me as a trauma gave me the confidence to challenge myself. I often hear from my friends that I am versatile. However, in fact, I think it's not because I'm good at it, but rather because I have a tendency to challenge myself with the mind of 'Shouldn't I be persistent?' Even though I had never learned Photoshop when I was working at a financial engineering association, I was in charge of producing promotional posters and watched YouTube lectures and made posters through Photoshop overnight. ""I booked a plane right away because I wanted to learn Chinese and studied there for a month. Like this, I will not be afraid of challenges for innovation and ability improvement at work,"" said Lee, ""I analyzed the propensity and consumption patterns of OOO (male interested in OOO) by using panel data of 115,854 respondents, the 2019 OO Big Data Analysis Competition, Excellence Award, Excellence Award. We measured the degree of interest in OO with a different approach and categorized the respondents accordingly, and conducted logistic regression, tree model, and correlation analysis to discover the patterns of consumption of the respondents, and organized them to gain marketing insights. [Intern], OOO Life Insurance's OOO management department, 20180917-20190228, daily stock and bond market conditions, calculated various risks related to the company's asset management, and prepared a report that integrates them. We performed the LAT simulation process with Excel VBA coding and automated existing iterative tasks to increase work efficiency."",,,,"
"""I will create synergy between knowledge and passion."" I majored in industrial management engineering, but I am a late programmer who finally found my aptitude for IT after finishing the semester. For me, I think that LG CNS' smart factory/smart logistics job is a golden opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge I learned in the department and my passion for IT. I majored in industrial management engineering to learn how to manage various variables generated in the process through classes such as production control and management science, and I have experience working on the 'analysis and proposal of the current process' project through internships in the manufacturing industry. LG CNS is an attractive company to me in that it verifies applicants through internships with SW Boot Camp during the recruitment process. It is because I can experience the job in advance, and I can also develop in the process. I want to join LG CNS proudly by proving the synergy of my knowledge of process and logistics and passion for IT. I have two competencies to perform the smart factory/smart logistics job. The first is the IT knowledge necessary to design and manage the smart factory. I have been trying to understand the system logic based on SW algorithm by learning the programming language. After obtaining the information processor certificate and completing the six-month SW developer training course, I was able to learn programming languages such as Java and Oracle DB, and learn the latest IT trends such as new technologies and new security threats. Also, this year, I am working as a full-time researcher at the school to improve my data analysis ability. We are assisting in the 'Defect Analysis according to Elevator Vibration Pattern' project, and are acquiring Python, an analysis tool, and preparing for the sqld certification. Second, it is the ability to handle variables from the perspective of the supply chain, such as the perspective of facilities and the perspective of raw materials. I learned how to establish strategies for SCM and facility preservation through 'Management Science 1' and 'Management Engineering' subjects, and learned how to derive the optimal solution of productivity using 'Search for Solutions'. Based on this major knowledge, I worked as an intern at a manufacturing company in the second semester of 2016 and conducted the 'Analysis and Improvement Proposal of the Current Process' project. We analyzed the inventory management process by writing the relationship before and after the production process in the SCM flow chart, and calculated the defect rate through verification of the worker's work inefficiency. As a result of constant analysis and feedback, we were able to establish the data, and in the end, we announced that an additional cost of 27% was incurred due to the occurrence of duplicate and work inefficiency of the storage flow. I think the smart factory/smart logistics job needs parallel knowledge because improvement should be made in the IT system based on the understanding of the process. Through my passion for programming and knowledge and experience in process scheduling, I will become an essential employee in the manufacturing job."""" Specialist of MES solution development LG CNS provides various types of solutions depending on the IT area and the industry of suppliers. Among them, I want to become an employee who develops MES solutions that can coexist together by maximizing QCDs of manufacturing partners. To this end, I will work hard to understand the MES solutions of LG CNS such as iPhone CarmMES based on the process knowledge and programming ability. I think we can increase the efficiency of job performance by learning the logic and application method of solution. In addition, we will find suppliers, analyze how they are actually operated, and improve them to improve their job performance. After that, I will draw my future, which is called the 'key human resource of MES solution construction' at LG CNS. I will become an engineer who can provide competitiveness and flexibility to suppliers in line with the production ecosystem that will change radically."",,,,"
"When I decided to become a developer, my biggest goal was to see as many people as possible use the programs I contributed conveniently. There are many programs that pass people's hands, but financial services are always a service that exists firmly next to one person, and I wanted to become a digital financier and contribute to the development of the programs that each customer needs to shine on the company and myself. Also, as I have a hobby of trading stocks and cryptocurrencies, as I used many financial transaction programs, I wanted to devote my passion to these big financial programs. During development, the most important thing is 'Can users use all services conveniently while using the programs without difficulty?' The purpose of the program is to provide comfortable and accessible services to users, so we should try to make it comfortable and accessible. I think the behavior of developing and thinking about how to always put customers first, whether they can receive services more comfortably and whether they can receive trust, is the responsibility I should have as a financial developer. When I used IBK's homepage and application, I was amazed that all the values that were important to me were incorporated. User-oriented functions and design arrangements greatly ignited my passion to work for IBK. Even within the job application page, I dreamed of becoming an IBK person because I thought there was a lot to learn about the existence of trivial but definitely convenient functions such as the number of characters on the right side of the page and a spelling calculator. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ""solving problems through quick response."" I created an automatic transaction bot using a homepage and a specific exchange API that informs the market price and information of cryptocurrency. There was a meeting where we shared information and talked while investing in cryptocurrency, and I shared that if anyone wanted to use the automatic transaction bot program that I created by myself, I would use it even though I was not good enough. In addition, I made the program by improving the program, receiving opinions such as inconvenience to users and functions that would be good to be added. There is a clear difference between the functions that users think of as developers and the functions that users think of as convenient, and there is always room for improvement, so communication with users is important and we continued the development. While developing, there was a time when the program failed due to changes in the API. If it was a program that I use alone and develop, there was no problem, but it could have been a big problem because it was an important moment for other acquaintances to trade money. However, after learning that the problem had occurred, I quickly identified the problem and canceled the user's linked private API key to block automatic transactions within the program, and solved the problem by modifying the program. It was a situation that could have caused a big problem, but as a result of responding calmly without panicking, I was able to solve the error without any problems. This experience made me feel the importance of quick response with my whole body, and I also learned that I have to take great responsibility in developing as a program distributor. Breaking down barriers between developers and users, communicating comfortably, and improving programs are critical to the development of programs. I am confident that I will fully perform my role as software engineering to design and implement programs, improve errors and convenience through testing, and distribute them to users to advance programs.""""The innovation I have experienced is fingerprint recognition. When early smartphones were developed, there were two main methods of locking mobile phones: passwords and patterns. However, this was a lock that was far from strong security because it could be easily unlocked if someone other than the owner knew the password or pattern of the phone. When iris recognition was subsequently performed through the front camera, I felt that security was stronger than before, but there were cases where errors unlocked someone else's iris, and above all, it was so far removed from the most important convenience that people did not use it much even though the function existed. I also thought that all of the above-mentioned locking methods were cumbersome and cumbersome that the functionality was so inconvenient that I used a cell phone without using the lock function. But since then, fingerprint recognition has been a huge innovation for me. The method of fingerprinting security was unthinkable, the only security device that identifies itself, and it was very convenient as a system that recognizes with a short touch of a finger. Fingerprint recognition, which continues to be used as a mobile security device and is increasingly utilized, has become indispensable. In the past, when using mobile banking, simple identity authentication using fingerprints from uncomfortable functions that had to include all special symbols, English and numbers, has made financial services one of the convenient functions of life. Innovative functions are not limited to one area, but can be used in many other areas, and I think they should be efficient in terms of convenience and have a powerful effect in terms of security. Seeing that fingerprint recognition, which was one of the unlocking functions of the mobile phone, is now being used in finance as it is now one of the self-authentication functions, I think there is no shortage in being selected as the most innovative function of today."" As fast and easy services are pursued, faster and more convenient functions are emerging into the world. I-ONE Bank, which allows you to use financial services with only six-digit passwords instead of public certificates or complex passwords in a financial environment, is also a feature that highlights differentiation and simplification in a rapidly changing financial environment. However, behind the easy and convenient functionality, security issues are looking for opportunities to catch on. Financial customers want quick and easy features, but they are concerned about security issues and worry about using them.The occurrence of problems can happen anytime, anywhere, under any circumstance. I can't guarantee that all problems are blocked at the source, but I think a quick response is always possible. When a problem occurs, first, a quick apology to customers, then calmly identify the cause and solution of the problem, inform customers transparently, and respond quickly to the problem, which can be an opportunity to increase trust in customers. Quick response that turns a crisis into an opportunity can be an opportunity to win favor from customers and enhance the image of the company. In addition to coping with problems within the company, it is necessary to be able to present a quick response to problems caused by customers' mistakes. Everything is possible with mobile phones, but on the other hand, it has become a world where nothing can be done without mobile phones. The first thing to worry about when you lose your phone is the problem of financial services. Although it is the occurrence of a problem due to the customer's own mistake, a quick response that blocks the source of the concern one step ahead of the company will greatly help the company's growth. At the center of the direction listed above is the customer. We need customer-centered thinking that always puts customers first. If you think from the customer's point of view and always keep in mind what features will make you more comfortable, the company's authenticity will open its heart and become a company that can reach people more comfortably."",,,,"
"""Theory is weak but practice is strong"" In the computer structure lecture, I ranked 32nd out of 40 students in the midterm theory test. It was the result of not studying much because my theory was weak and overlapped with other tests. I usually listened to the lecture hard, but my midterm score was low, so I felt denied for listening to the lecture hard. I thought that the way to prove that I listened to the lecture hard was a practice project, so I set my goal of winning first place in the project. There were a total of 8 teams, so I thought it would not be easy to win first place. The project was to design an electronic calculator using Logic works. Basically, it was a project that was given an electronic calculator capable of only four four-digit arithmetic operations and added with the function in mind. Through meetings with team members, since the logic circuit consists of binary digits, we implemented the octogenarian converter, exponential functions, factoring, permutation, and combination operations. The aforementioned functions were implemented in the same way by other team members, which faced an obstacle of implementing new functions. In order to achieve the target of winning first place, a differentiated function was unconditionally required. Looking at the calculator to implement differentiated functions, I looked through Google how the calculations were performed and found that sin, cos could be implemented. Both sin and cos were implemented by simply calculating the front part using Taylor series to express the approximation. I added sin, cos, and finally, changed the calculation to 5 digits to complete the project. As I was working on the project, I thought I could win first place because I had invested 3 hours a day constantly in the project and created more functions than other teams. As a result of the project presentation and demonstration, our team was the only one who implemented trigonometric functions, and we achieved the result that we implemented the most functions and won first place in the project. From this experience, I learned that if you work hard, you will always get a result. SK C&C will also continue to work hard to prove the results of your work as achievements and contribute to the development of SK C&C through achievements."" ""Reduced number of return cases through meetings"" Working as a OOOOO tester, I served as the contact app domain leader. The common task was to solve OOO-related problems that came in every day, and as a leader, I assigned the task to the team members, synthesized it again, and reported it to the manager. In the process of solving the problem, the individual handled the problem, but even if the problem was corrected, it could not be solved and it was returned. Reprocessing the problem that has been returned resulted in a waste of time because the problem was handled twice, which could be solved at once. In order to prevent waste of time, we suggested to team members that difficult problems be resolved through meetings as a solution to reduce the number of return cases. The reason I haven't used the meeting in the meantime is that I'm concerned that even if a meeting is held, rejection may occur and it can be a waste of time because we spend time solving one problem together. However, I thought it would be wrong to judge the result before trying, so I tried for now. The introduction of the meeting had the effect of reducing the number of return cases, which was the previous goal. Time also resulted in an increase in the total workload of the problem, rather than falling at all, even if the time of the meeting was used, as the time to reprocess the return cases decreased. The manager suggested the same problem-solving method to other domains because of the successful result of reducing companion cases and increasing time efficiency. Conference was introduced in all domains afterwards as a result. SK C&C will also think of a more efficient way to solve the task in the process of solving the task through the experience of having successful results by incorporating new things, and will make an effort to increase the work efficiency by suggesting it to the team members.""""Still strengthening Programming Capabilities"" It is the basic and core of Solution SW's job. Because it is necessary to understand and process one's work. I made the following efforts to improve my programming capabilities. First, I took lectures focusing on programming. In the case of mandatory majors according to the completion system of the information and communication engineering department, the proportion of telecommunication and network lectures is higher than that of programming lectures. As a result, I thought that the required programming lectures were not enough, so I took the elective major mainly on programming lectures. By taking lectures on object-oriented language, practice, data structure, computer algorithm, and practice, I learned languages such as C++ and JAVA, learned algorithms and data structure, and built up programming skills. Second, I studied algorithms. I thought I needed to study algorithms because I thought algorithms were the core of programming. I studied algorithm theory first and then learned the basics by doing basic implementation. After that, I solved algorithm problems through online algorithm problem solving sites, reviewed my motives, and each code, and developed application skills. In addition to solving problems, I also studied algorithmic capabilities by completing 40 hours of special lectures on algorithms at Samsung SDS. Third, I worked on several projects. When I worked on projects such as ""Healthcare Application using Smart Watch"" and ""Smart Door Lock using BLE Beacons,"" I realized the right functions of each project. The projects received A+ and B+ grades, respectively. Through the results of the project, I was able to confirm my capabilities and realized that I should work harder. I think there is no end to the study of the developer. I think the moment I am complacent at my level, I am eliminated. In order not to be eliminated, I will constantly strive to strengthen my capabilities. I will do my best to become a company that will not be stopped even after joining SK C&C, but will always continue to be a talented person who will not be eliminated. In conjunction with OOOOO Systems, we have undertaken a graduation project under the theme of ""Smart Door Lock Using BLE Beacons.""It was too much to do everything alone by using the application, Arduino, server, and DB in the project, so I found a team, and four people including myself formed a team so that they could take on one part each. It was a short project that lasted for two months after the team was set up, and through a meeting with a company mentor, I set my goal to complete the unlocking function of the door lock according to the security level first. I was in charge of the application. First, I used Beacon for the first time, looked it up on Google, and studied it by asking a motive who used it before. After studying, I started implementing the function. After implementing a simple login system, I implemented a function that measures the distance from the target function, beacon, determines user information, and sends an unlocking signal to Arduino. In the process of checking whether the function is working normally with the Arduino team member, if the distance was set short, the problem of reaching the door before the door opened occurred. We continuously tested it so that it could be properly opened in time for the user to reach the door, and found and set the optimal distance of 3m. We successfully achieved the previously targeted results by integrating the implementation parts into one and creating a prototype with a storage cabinet by implementing each of the team members responsibly. In the process of writing patent drafts for submission after the project, there was a disagreement over whether to write the subject as a smart door lock or a small-scale bicycle smart lock. To select a topic, I consulted a mentor and was recommended a bicycle lock that was not registered in the existing patent, so I wrote the patent drafts as a bicycle lock. Based on the experience of collaborating with others on tasks that are difficult to do alone and trying to achieve common goals, SK C&C will also try to achieve the goal as an individual or a team member."",,,,"
"""Life with Games"" When I was in the lower grades of elementary school, I liked to play outside with my friends, and I was far from computer games or studying. Then, in the fourth grade, I came across Maple Story, which started its service in 2003. Easy and simple horizontal scrolling and cute graphics caught my attention, and I was able to experience characters from warriors, archers, wizards, bandits, and all occupations. Another game that was popular among classmates at the time was Crazy Arcade, where I played games for a long time, admiring the novel ideas of suppressing opponents with water balloons and the easy difficulty that anyone could play. Since then, I have expanded my feet by encountering Kart Rider and other games such as Trickster, Vegetable Club, and Grand Chase. In the sixth grade of elementary school, instead of running with friends on the playground after school, I even went to a PC room for the first time to play games together. I remember being amazed by playing games on computers with good specifications unlike at home. While entering middle school, I became interested in studying and always maintained a top grade. In the meantime, however, I enjoyed playing rhythm games such as O2Jam and DJ Max when I was not studying. I felt pleasure whenever I achieved a higher score than my opponent by choosing a song that was difficult to clear and competing with other players. When I entered a special purpose high school, I gave up all my hobbies because I was so into college entrance exams, and I focused only on studying in order to make choices that I would not regret in the future. After completing my long four-year entrance exam, after going to the university I wanted, I found the game again as a resting place when I was tired of difficult majors. In 2016, a game called Blizzard Overwatch was released, and when I went to a PC room with my friend's recommendation and played it together, I became interested in FPS after a long time since Sudden Attack I played in my childhood. Since then, I have enjoyed Nexon and Nadic Games' Closer for a while, and also played League of Legends, which had been the No. 1 PC room share for several years. In 2018, I returned to Maple Story, which ended the story of a black wizard with ""Teraboning."" During my five-year college life, whenever I was exhausted by midterm and final exams, I visited the PC room in front of the school to soothe myself. In retrospect, my life has always been with gaming."" ""My most passionate games for nearly two years were the online games ""Overwatch"" and ""Maple Story."" In 2016, as a junior, I had been depressed a lot after being hit with tough majors in engineering, and one of my best friends recommended me to play Overwatch. I was fascinated by the new genre of FPS, in which the team's strategic play is important, and I was fascinated by characters with a completely different style of play, although they have jobs like offense, defense, tanker, and healer. Overwatch was initially only a battle between players and competition for skill, but over time, it added different modes of play, and I think the most impressive piece of content that has been added is the melee that continues the overall story of Overwatch. I think the fact that there are no limits to the highest level of that game is another thing that sets me apart from other games. My level is now 414, and I have about 224 hours of play. Nexon's flagship MMORPG game, Maple Story, returned to action after watching the premiere of ""The Black,"" which released the final content of ""The Wizard"" in June 2018, which may seem like a short period of time, but the playing time is by far the best. Except for the exam period, I ran to the PC room and enjoyed Maple Story after finishing my studies. Back then, Maple Story released ""Terabening,"" a new content that improves the level by 3 to 200, and it didn't seem difficult to come back. Its highest level is now 275, and its highest level character has now achieved 211. Not long ago, Terabening returned for the vacation season, creating another professional character with level 200."" Among the games I have played in the last five years, online games include Maple Story 2, Elsod, Closer, League of Legends, Overwatch, and mobile games include Kakao Friends games, Kakao-Grand Chase, and Fate Grand Order. Among them, I will tell you about Cypherds and League of Legends. The two games have something in common called AOS, and the strategy of purchasing the right items, raising skill levels in real time, and taking down the opponent's team felt pretty difficult to me. The most interesting games were Overwatch, MapleStory, and MapleStory 2. For me, who didn't usually enjoy playing FPS that kills opponents with weapons in the first person's perspective, the importance of ""strategic team play"" such as taking up a foothold or pushing cargo seems to have come to me fresh. MapleStory, which was not an exaggeration to say that we grew up together since childhood, continued to introduce new content for about 15 years without stopping, and as a result, it had the charm of keeping the old feeling of longing. MapleStory 2 is the 3D version of MapleStory, so it was not difficult to adapt to the game because its essential content was similar, and I felt anew that I could customize my characters by creating my own 3D modeling. The least interesting game was the Closer. Obviously, the Closer's world view was fresh and the characters were attractive. The game itself wasn't boring, but a lot of bugs that couldn't be fixed and a leak of RAM halved the fun while playing. In addition, the consistent company's refusal to collect customer feedback seems to have made me increasingly tired and less interested as a user.""'Perfectionism for others' and 'playing games faster than anyone else' Since I was a child, I have been interested in games, and I have often looked for game-related tasks. Front-end development, back-end development, game planning, game art, game service, etc. There were numerous occupations at a glance. Among them, QA is especially the final process of making games, and hearing that careful work is required to reduce the inconvenience of game users due to bugs, I thought that it would be a good job for me, who felt uncomfortable if I didn't finish anything perfectly. Not only that, but it also felt attractive to be able to enjoy new contents of the game before other users. Entering college and entering my second year, I transferred to the Department of Convergence Engineering (now a software major) as a digital imaging major. Then, in my senior year, I took a major class called Network Game Programming. Understanding the concept of TCP/IP, building my own client and server to enable communication, and making games using it was the final task of the Network Game Programming course. Building the server wasn't easy for me, and I had to deal with a lot of bugs from the start. However, the process didn't feel painful. I would be absolutely delighted if I could make my own game perfect and someone else could enjoy it. With that mindset, I successfully created a small game that can compete one-on-one with users connected to the same server in real time after debugging countless times. And throughout my five years of college, I have consistently engaged in IT-related external activities. Throughout my career, I worked as OOO ICT mentoring supporters, Jotaek computer supporters, and supportive supporters of the game industry, I developed knowledge of the game industry and computer utilization skills, and communicated with my colleagues with respect for each activity. I think that my experience and my accumulated major knowledge will be helpful in communicating with developers to fix big and small bugs in the game. ""QA to challenge, QA to communicate."" If I join Nexon Networks and become a game QA, I will go beyond simply fixing the bug and suggest ways to improve the game. When I play the game from my user's point of view, I suddenly think, ""If this place is improved like this, users will be able to play the game more comfortably!"" Rather than arbitrarily deciding on these opinions, I will communicate with other users through SNS and lead the game improvement in the best direction. So my goal is to create a ""God Game"" that satisfies both the game producer and the user who plays the game. ""As always, as the first time."" Even three years after I join the company, I want to be recognized as the same person as the first time. I don't want to become a QA that handles things roughly as the trick increases even if I get used to my work. I will always keep my original intentions and keep poring over the game to see if there is anything wrong and if there is anything to improve. For the user, the same game will be a QA that plays dozens and hundreds of times with joy."",,,,"
"""Competition"" He was an ordinary kid with nothing special about him from an early age. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends. I felt greedy that if someone did something, I could do just as much. The first step is to compete against a one-year-old Tuol's cousin when she turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy while memorizing a Chinese script, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. After learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and as a result, I got excellent grades in Chinese literature when I was in middle and high school. During my school years, I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and started memorizing world maps, and I appeared in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Another time, when my friend's writing skills improved greatly, I started reading and essay writing and won an essay contest for the first time in my life. In the past and now, I am an ordinary person. However, I have a strong aspiration to improve myself. I will continue to digest the strengths of those around me as my own and develop myself."" For stable system operation, I took Internet security. I constructed and redistributed network construction using routers, dynamic static routing tables, and built firewalls using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time, and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for eight months, understanding security threats from systems, networks, and applications, and learning how to operate security equipment. I think my strength is that I have used various server OSs in college and vocational education. When I was an undergraduate, I mainly used Ubuntu and Fedora, and I dealt with Sentos, Cali, and Windows servers in vocational education. In addition, I have experience of checking vulnerabilities of servers using Bashshell. After joining the company, I will master work quickly with a high understanding of the server. On the other hand, I failed to take the security management law course in the security engineer's writing this year due to my weakness in information protection laws and policies. With this opportunity, I had time to complete the personal information protection education and work together on the personal information protection law and security authentication system."" ""I first got to know Kali Linux while receiving information security education. Since it was developed for simulated hacking, various hacking tools were built-in, but it took considerable time and effort to learn 13 categories and more than 200 tools. So, I gathered friends and organized a hacking tool study. We decided to divide the groups of five evenly and present only two or three tools that we think are important. With the experience of learning in advance, it was easy to follow this class, and it was a good experience to increase the sense of responsibility for the task through efficient division of labor. In addition, by sharing the organized materials with the students in the same class, everyone could easily finish the mock hacking chapter.""""When I was a freshman, I had a major class where I presented as a group with a second-year senior every month. Due to my passive personality, I couldn't say a word properly at the first presentation. I prepared a lot, but I was so embarrassed because I didn't show anything. So I tried step by step to improve my presentation skills. In the next presentation, I made a script and presented it, and then I presented it with only keywords written. So, in the last presentation, I was able to talk to everyone in the eye. As a newbie, it is impossible to turn over a difficult task in an instant."" However, there will be no impossible if you divide difficult tasks into small pieces and realize them with a small but certain degree."" ""Responsibility."" ""When I was in charge of promoting a project on the theme of corporate security, I collected opinions from the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the members of the group devoted themselves to their duties, but as time passed, they remained silent. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was lower than that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the deficiencies. All of the members of the group said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested in. So, I applied for a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, I was rejected because it was an important factor in the life and death of the company. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard that the World IT Show was holding a special industrial security exhibition. I was able to meet my questions and have a hands-on access to security products and new technologies while conducting hands-on interviews with my team members. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing my participation in the project within a short period of time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. I always plan and proceed with anything with the principle of ""flexibility"" important. So, I often hear that I am ignorant among my friends. There are times when things go smoothly due to thorough preparation and planning, but there are times when things go awry due to unexpected tasks. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to others. Whenever there is a disruption in performing my duties, I will take all the opinions of the members and come up with a variety of best practices. I will become a talented person who can handle any crisis skillfully and perform successfully."" Starting from the ""Growing Company"" consultative meeting, KINX has now grown into a global Internet infrastructure company by partnering with European Internet operators beyond China and Japan. However, rather than focusing on IX services, I have come to support the company by seeing its growth and growth in new attempts such as CDN, IDC, and Cloud. In addition, practical welfare programs that support books, telecommunications, and self-development, and in-house events that promote unity among employees will greatly help the company grow by enhancing the company's compassion.""""I think it is more important to put the assets and information of our customers first than to provide convenient services. I would like to manage and operate the network and system infrastructure at IDC Center and encounter various errors and server attacks. Based on my experience as a system engineer, I will strive to establish a security system. To this end, I will do systematic and continuous information protection activities.We will analyze past hacking cases to establish defense policies, subscribe to major security reports such as Cisco, Symantec, and KISA regularly, and learn new technologies and security information. We will acquire CISSP and CISA within 5 years to gain international-level security technology capabilities and contribute to PIMS and cloud certification marks. Thus, we will become KINX's leading security expert.""""Talent for Change"" In the summer of 2017, I worked part-time at OOOO to supply materials to production lines. Although it was a well-known conglomerate in the industry, material management was not systematic. There were many cases where there was no stock left or it was in the wrong location on the computer, which led to conflict with the production line. I planned and proposed a new inventory management system called ""Pre-action and Post-reporting"" and received a positive evaluation from the team leader. Anyone could have done it, but I don't think he did it because it was outside his boundaries. I will become a talented person who does not fall into mannerisms even in the midst of repetitive work and pursues an innovative future.""���,,,"
"""Habit of making a solid plan"" I always set core goals and make long-term and unit plans before I go to work. This personality is one of the things I want to brag about the most, because I have achieved satisfactory results on my own. When I was a test taker, I always kept a daily life record and made a study plan every day, week, and month, and as a result of making up for my shortcomings, I gradually raised my score until the SAT and went to the university I wanted. During the enlistment, I found the necessary certificate and made a study plan, and as a result, I acquired certificates such as information processing technician and 1st grade computer activity along with an increase of 250 points on TOEIC. In addition, I was dispatched to the Eulji Training Center in the National Police Agency with the recommendation of the commanding agent who liked this aspect. Recently, I made a portfolio development plan a month ago, and as a result of actively using planning and management programs such as OneNote and Trello, I have completed the development of character tools. By further developing and utilizing these personalities, I will work meticulously to reduce problems that occur in the middle of development. There were times when I thought of an easy problem as complicated when I was coding ""efforts to improve algorithms,"" and I wanted to develop my ability to implement algorithms quickly and easily to overcome them. So I practiced at various algorithmic sites and studied the types and solutions. In addition, I participated in algorithmic competitions such as 'OOO Coding Festival' and 'UCPC' to compensate for my shortcomings, and I recently passed the OOO online test. I have a personality that likes to actively help and socialize with people who are ""friendly."" Through this, I also participated in job interviews with friends who were worried about getting a job, and the personality test that I conducted recently showed the highest score for social type and consideration for others. By demonstrating this personality, I will try to help the company proceed with projects smoothly without any problems. ""Collaboration experience through competitions."" In order to gain collaboration skills, I participated in contests with friends from various fields and won prizes, and I also learned personal lessons. At that time, I was the head of the development team and developed core technologies, serving as a link with other fields. When there was a problem between fields in implementing the server, I gathered my team members in person to hold a meeting and found an efficient way to implement the KakaoTalk API. There was a burden of learning new technologies, but I realized it with a sense of responsibility that it must be developed, resulting in increased accessibility. Through this, I learned the lessons of 'soft communication skills' and 'if you have a sense of responsibility, the rewards will definitely follow' along with external achievements. In addition, I will contribute to 'completed development' at the company based on the above experience. Lastly, I developed basic physical strength as a developer by studying and exercising English in my spare time. When I studied programming, I often referred to materials in English, and since then, I have been continuously studying English on a site called 'OOOOOOOO'. In addition, I have been increasing my endurance by exercising PT in my spare time to overcome the difficulties that arise during development with my mental strength. As a result, English literature can now be accessed without difficulty, and exercise can now be performed twice as much as before. If I join Gamevil, I will do my best to contribute to the company by steadily developing the necessary competencies in addition to the above. ""Technology of a company that entered the global market"" The reason I applied for Gamevil is that I am interested in the company's ""global technology."" Since childhood, I played many games and dreamed of becoming a game developer. So I launched my developed games on the market, won a prize in a competition I participated in to gain collaboration skills, and gained competence by studying at a game development institute. With these efforts, my current goal has become ""developing world-class games."" In this regard, I wanted to join Gamevil, a ""global mobile game company."" Gamevil is currently the only Korean game company with both business and development capabilities. With various publishing experiences, I went overseas one step ahead of other companies to conduct marketing and operations at home and abroad. In addition, he strengthened his HIVE platform and development technology by acquiring Com2uS, a rival company. He applied to become the head of Gamevil, which produces great results every year in the global market beyond Korea, and he wanted to learn technology, know-how, and a wide range of perspectives, and I want to develop a 'Global Game with 100 million downloads' in your company. ""Global Game Development Team Leader."" My goal is to become the 'Global Game Development Team Leader' that fits the company's talent and ultimately encompasses Gamevil's home and abroad. To this end, I will faithfully perform my duties at the beginning of my employment to earn the trust of my team members, and use my time outside of work to improve my English and algorithmic skills. Within five years after joining the company, I would like to participate as a developer of games that are being recognized as an 'active and growing developer' and, if I have the opportunity, I will participate in domestic and international development seminars to expand my knowledge and build my own development skills. After gaining such experience, I would like to become the 'Worldwide Game Development Team Leader' at Gamevil within 10 years. I would like to pass on my experiences to my colleagues and read them as well as lead them to grow together. Through this, I aim to develop a game that provides stable service overseas and I would like to challenge myself to present my team's technical skills at overseas conferences. I will try to help the company develop by achieving my goals step by step.""""Com2us Professional Baseball Series."" There are three main reasons why I like to play the Com2us Professional Baseball Series. 1.Real-time updates reflect players' actual performance since I was a child, so I naturally downloaded and played baseball games from the days of feature phones. I have played countless baseball games, ranging from in-person games such as ""Magumagu"" and ""Isamanru"" to management games such as ""Professional Baseball Manager"" and ""Professional Baseball H2."" However, this was the first time that the game was updated every week to reflect actual performance, and I felt the biggest fun in this regard. The game was operated in line with the slogan of aiming for the most realistic baseball game, so I was able to play it more interestingly. 2. As a person who aims to develop various patterns and commentary, I was most fascinated by it. Individual players have different sounds from the stands, and I felt the variety of ways in which players handle pitches. Also, I was able to play richly with both my eyes and ears, with the most commentary I have ever played. The number of test cases that I didn't usually think about when coding algorithms increased, but I am more impressed as a developer because I think I have realized unimaginable number of complicated cases with excellent algorithms in Com2uS pro baseball. 3. Real-life graphics, player, and stadium model When I also played NCsoft's H2 game, I felt the distinctiveness of Com2S pro baseball. First of all, the pace modeling of players in Com2S pro baseball became more detailed than in Com2S pro baseball. In addition, I think Com2S pro baseball has been meticulously implemented in that there are close-ups of players in key scenes. Lastly, in Com2S pro baseball, the detailed design of the stadium and the characteristics of the stadium made the players more immersed in the play. So, I was able to immerse myself more in Com2S pro baseball because of these points."""" Outstanding Portfolio of OOOO"" In the recent program, I was selected as an Outstanding Portfolio in Programming. The contents of the portfolio are as follows. 1. 3D Game Character Tool Period: 2018.08.10 ~ 2018.09.15 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 11 Description: You can fight a demo and edit, save, and import the character members transform/model/collider/animation/action tree. Its core purpose is to implement Unity's UI structure, component method, and Unreal's behavior tree technology directly. 2. 3D Map Editor Period: 2018.05.06 ~ 2018.05.07 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 11 Description: A program that edits the terrain and installs, saves, and imports Billboard and models. It is designed to obtain the technology of 'command pattern' among the design patterns and utilization of Fbxsdk, an external library. 3. 3D Tetris Period: 2018.03.17 ~ 2018.03.19 Personnel: One Development Language: C++, DirectX 9 Description: It is a game made by transforming the general 2D Tetris into 3D. It has improved the technology to implement puzzle algorithms and basic knowledge about 3D mathematics. 4. Metal Slug 3 Period: July 30, 2017-10.10 Personnel: One Person Development Language: C++, DirectX 9 Description: I copied Metal Slug 3. I studied basic design patterns and physical equations and applied them to my projects. ""Development skills gained through personal development and completion of the game academy."" First, I learned the game development process through the experience of developing puzzle games using JAVA and releasing them in the Google market while I was in university. In addition, I studied at the academy for a year to develop more systematic game development skills. While completing the academy, I made sure to complete the assignments and portfolios within the deadline, which raised the confidence in development and problem-solving skills. In addition, I also received a perfect attendance award for my sincere work in the process. In addition, while using DirectX 11 or developing games based on commercial engines, I gained experience in producing various 2D and 3D game contents. In particular, I had a great interest in design patterns and established designs through the experience of easily solving complex branches using ""state patterns."" So I tried to read design-related books such as ""Coding Technology"" and ""Refactoring"" and study open sources and apply them to projects. As a result, I have the ability to abstract common parts by drawing diagrams before coding and the ability to utilize various design patterns. I think these technologies will contribute to building a solid structure for the game.""���,,,"
"A challenge is to take risks, set goals, self-improve and take initiative in order to achieve them. I have built my own career by 'challenging' a new field for my dream. When I was in my second year of college, I was very interested in big data analysis that looked into the future by reading a book called Signal and Noise. I thought that the core basis of big data analysis was to build a platform for storing and processing vast amounts of data, so I dreamed of becoming a big data developer. To this end, I took the risk of starting a new field called IT and challenged the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course. First, I set my goal to be proficient in Java. Although I had difficulties with APIs and algorithms I encountered for the first time, I implemented programs such as mine search and multi-chatting after trying to know for sure through code refactoring. Furthermore, by completing the 'Academy Management Program' and the 'Social Baseball Organization Website' MVC2 project, I was able to acquire the ability to develop Java and various web development languages, Oracle DB, and spring framework. Through the successful completion of the course, I was able to learn the value of the challenge by acquiring my own know-how to acquire new fields as well as the basic skills of development. I will become a Hanwha person who constantly challenges and does not settle for the existing framework and develops day by day. Through the academy management project, I learned that 'collaboration' is to help each other's difficulties and move in a better direction. As I proceeded with the project, there was a difficulty in overall development progress due to the unbalanced division of work. The server I was in charge of had a high proportion of work because data transmission and reception had to be done with all clients. We publicized this problem situation and talked together, and found that the team members also had a burden of work. Based on related functions and logic, it was suggested to reorganize the division of work to cooperate more than before. With the help of the team members, I was able to build the server easily, and I also won first place in the process by analyzing the code created by the team members and demonstrating cooperation to help them complete their functions. Through teamwork by sharing not only each other's difficulties but also knowledge and experience, I was able to realize efficient work. Based on this, I will become a Hanwha person who can approach the difficulties of my colleagues first. In order to provide practical help, I will grasp the overall work process and secure expertise in the field I am in charge of. I once caused damage to my team members by giving up specialized training in Data Science. At that time, I did not have enough time to participate in the training while working on the MVC2 project, so I did not have enough time to fulfill my role. I studied R with the help of my team members to analyze the csv file I was in charge of, but I was eventually forced to quit the training due to the deadline for the project. I learned desperately that excessive motivation can cause great damage to the organization. Since then, I have made an effort not to reverse my failure by organizing schedules on a weekly basis, allocating priorities, and finishing important tasks in turn. Through this, I will become a member of Hanwha S&C who can completely perform my tasks and devote myself to the organization."" First, I am constantly interested in and execution of new technologies. After completing the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, I was very interested in storing and processing big data and started studying Hadoop immediately. I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase in a CentOS-based Linux environment, and I grew interested by analyzing vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus rides and U.S. aviation data. Based on my learned knowledge, I built a Hadoop cluster using AWS EC2 and am currently learning machine learning using regression analysis by working on a Spark MLib project based on EMR. Through this, I have developed my capability to build a data distributed processing platform related to Hanwha S&C's HONE-G platform. I want to grow into a big data developer who has secured expertise in distributed and parallel processing architecture by demonstrating my strengths. Second, I have math and statistical knowledge. If you lack understanding of data analysis terms and related formulas, you cannot provide the dataset that the analyst wants. While taking differential equations and applied mathematics, I dealt with complex formulas, learned numerical analysis, learned MATLAB, and improved my understanding of formulas used for data analysis. In addition, in order to gain knowledge of data analysis, I acquired data analysis quasi-professional certificates and learned data mining and R programming. Based on this knowledge, we will communicate smoothly with analysts and quickly provide the latest open-source technology needed."""""" I think SMART&CREATIVE is a creative thinking that looks at new problems and acquires the skills needed for improvement. This is essential to discover new IT technologies and apply them in the right place. In particular, the IT industry is making the transformation and innovation of IT convergence by utilizing creative thinking. Hanwha S&C has also used SMART&CREATIVE as its vision slogan to provide ""smart service that is always one step ahead of customer expectations."" I have experience in daily precipitation forecasting projects that successfully built a Hadoop cluster by introducing cloud. I came up with AWS that rents out capacity virtually, away from the traditional method of using VMware to secure insufficient capacity. After collecting and organizing academic materials, making my own manual to learn EC2, I was able to set up a security group and IP, and then connecting with putty to allocate sufficient capacity to build a cluster consisting of five nodes. It was a small project, but it was able to produce meaningful results. ""We were able to not only solve problems in a different way, but also learn the IaaS cloud and broaden our learning. We will not hesitate to learn new tools and languages for improvement, such as Hanwha S&C, which has the best cloud technology and significantly reduces the time cost of migration by introducing a 'jet converter' solution, breaking away from the traditional manual work.""���,,,"
"""Challenge: Courage to walk on the path of new ICT"" Among Hanwha's core values, I think I am a person close to ""challenge."" A challenge is the courage to walk on a path that no one has taken. I am from Seoul and Beijing, but I am currently working as a developer through various challenges. When I was a second year of undergraduate school, I translated for overseas exhibitions at an ICT company called OOO. At that time, I became interested in the field of ICT and started the challenge by taking a major in the IT department within the school. In order to make these challenges an opportunity, I prepared for all of my majors during the vacation, and gained confidence by getting close to perfect scores in most IT majors. After that, I left school and challenged myself. First, I worked for a year as an intern in the data department of OOOOOO, a clothing brand located in the U.S. As I was working on data management and research, I became interested in the data field, so I returned to Korea and looked for big data development work. Thanks to my hard work in programming during my undergraduate years, I joined the internship in the SW development department of OOOOOO, which is in charge of OOOO's digital solutions business, last October. It took a lot of challenges to start this unfamiliar path of ICT and to do development work. I have the courage to take on the challenge and the ability to bring those challenges to achievement. There were two projects that I remember the most about collaboration, ""True Meaning of Collaboration."" They were all in the same problem situation, but I was able to learn true collaboration with different responses. The first was the TCP/IP socket game programming project in the advanced programming class. This project was memorable as a case of failure. Despite being a programming class, it was a problem that all the team members didn't know how to code. The team members who couldn't code couldn't do anything because implementation was more important than strategy planning, and it was a tough situation because their teamwork score accounted for 30 percent in the project evaluation. In the end, I made all the projects by myself, and I couldn't produce the best results. The second is the HSI and RGB color model conversion project in the digital media class. For this project, we first had to understand the formula for converting HSI and RGB, and then we had to express it visually and finally we had three tasks to create code. This project also had a variety of team members, and most of them were not able to code. However, we tried to find what we were good at and collaborate as much as possible based on our previous experience of failure. A classmate who was good at math solved a formula and taught it, a classmate who was an art student expressed a color model in three dimensions, and finally, I worked on a program by solving the formula that I learned from my team member in three dimensions. I learned a lot from the fact that these students who are specialized in different fields can meet and produce results with a single goal. I was able to learn that collaboration is not just about dividing work and division of labor, but about working together in a single direction while taking charge of areas where we can do well with each other."","" [Understanding and Experience with Mobile Services] - For the job of developing and operating an application, it will first be necessary to understand the relationship between mobile services and users. Since my undergraduate years, I have been interested in UX and have taken related majors. In particular, I was able to increase my understanding of the user experience by experiencing a project to improve the service usage experience of Naver and KakaoTalk in the mobile service design class. Based on this, I participated in OOOO's Retail Shop Event App Project while working for OOOO. As an indoor location service app using beacon, I was in charge of managing beacon in this project and linking beacon to Android using OOOO's CMS. Through this, I was able to experience that large projects were systematically operated according to Agile methodology. I also learned that it is important to build and manage log data well for better service. [Practical English Competency] - I think English competency will be important as we have various overseas branches. I usually studied English steadily to develop my major, and as a result, I was able to get opportunities such as interpreting at overseas exhibitions and working at the headquarters in the United States. Through these experiences, I was able to develop my practical English skills. We can use this to communicate for better service operation and development.""""Creating a business that reflects users' future demand through technology"" First of all, I think that ""SMART"" is not just about sticking to the performance of technology in solutions, but about developing and operating that is more optimized for ""people."" In addition, I think ""CREATIVE"" is to predict users' future demand to create optimized services and implement services by obtaining new business insights through them. The current ICT industry is changing rapidly, and I think the trend of that change is ""people."" It is no longer a trend for people to learn skills, but to think and predict people, not technology. In this regard, I think Hanwha S&C's vision slogan is the best slogan to respond to the changing trends in the ICT industry. Since October last year, I have participated in a big data research project at Funta to present the business direction. In this project, I collected 9.5 million SNS data related to K-pop and developed code to find the meaning in the data by utilizing open sources such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning. Through this experience, I learned that the big data field can contribute to the creation of new services that reflect trends, and I was able to develop my relevant capabilities. Based on this, I want to become a solution expert who reads the hearts of customers of Hanwha S&C.""���,,,"
"""Individual development is the development of a company."" I have seen a documentary about eBay Korea's Hackathon. Through this, I felt the development culture of eBay Korea and the passion of the members for development, and decided that I must join the company. I am a person who grows up on my own with pleasure always in mind. For example, I have built up my development capabilities by challenging internships and development clubs with the goal of becoming a Back-End developer. In addition, I worked on my own projects to solve the inconveniences around me. For example, I developed a department bulletin board notification system and a self-introduction letter management system. As such, I would like to take the initiative in learning and grow as a developer in five or 10 years. In this respect, eBay Korea decided to apply because it has a culture where developers can grow. I think Hackathon is a great culture where individual capabilities actively contribute to the growth of the company. This is because I can give pleasure and meaning to my employees and make them have a sense of ownership in that I contribute directly. Therefore, I think that my professional values to work, always thinking that it is my job, can be harmonized well on eBay. ""I will become an S/W developer who can contribute to eBay through leading growth."" ""Web Programming"" It is a subject that made me aim to become a back-end developer. It was interesting to interact with the database inside the web application, design the business logic, and write the code that provides direct service. I studied Servlet/JSP by myself, and furthermore, I was equipped with the ability to build API servers using Spring Boot. In addition, I was in charge of back-end development in development clubs and interns, and I often used Ajax and JavaScript. Based on this, I will contribute to eBay Korea's back-end development. ""Data Structure"" It was interesting to solve the structure of data and while implementing it. Furthermore, it was a subject that gave me an opportunity to come across what is called problem solving programming. While interacting with this subject, I learned algorithms such as full exploration, DP, and alignment. I attended the class by creating my own library through the process of getting to the core of the problem and generalizing it. Also, it was interesting to learn different ways of thinking by looking at other people's codes. Even after joining the company, I will continue to learn algorithms so that data structure and algorithm knowledge can be used for actual work.""""Department bulletin board""Department bulletin board is not RSS supported, so I could not receive notifications when a new article was posted. To solve this inconvenience, I carried out my own personal project. It periodically crawls the bulletin board based on Quartz scheduling, and performs data comparison based on the key of the MAP to search for a new article. If you find a new article, it consists of the process of sending FCM to users who want to be notified of it. This project is developing with me. When I first started this project, I used Socket. However, I learned JSP/Servlet, Spring Boot, and ORM through personal learning, internship, and development club activities, applied them to the project, and performed refactoring. Even after joining the company, I will not only use my knowledge or work, but also apply it to personal projects to improve my development skills. In addition, if there are any inconveniences in the way we work, we will become a developer who can solve them with software. ""Tag-based Image Search"" ""I have experience participating in OOO and developing a ""Clothes Search"" that can find clothes for specific shopping malls as images. I used Microsoft's Custom Vision Service API. The ""Clothes Search"" searches for images using the data learned based on tags. For example, if you upload a related image with TAG {One Piece, Check}, the image for the TAG has been learned. Here, when a user uploads a specific image, the system analyzes it and informs the similarity for each TAG in numbers, and outputs and shows images in the system with tags higher than 90%. If the above technology is used in eBay Korea, it will be able to lead E-Commerce in its clothing field. The first reason is the rise of user experience. Unstructured thoughts are difficult to search because they are difficult to express in keywords. If a user can search for clothes with images, it can be a service that can satisfy usability and usefulness. The second reason is to gain customers in the apparel sector. Unique and innovative services will be an opportunity for customers to use eBay Korea.""���,,,"
"My strength is that I am meticulous, meticulous, and I want to finish something perfectly when I do it. Sometimes, I like to follow the standard of practice enough to be told by my colleagues that I feel frustrated because I don't know the ropes well. Because of this personality, I am studying not only the previous questions by memorizing them, but also by reading the basic books, understanding the theories accurately, and moving on, and then by reviewing the contents through the previous questions, I think I was able to achieve good results in the academic exam or the certificate exam. My weakness is an obsession caused by pursuing perfection. I get more stress than others because I think I am in serious trouble if I don't meet the daily tasks or quotas because I set a goal of doing something until the end of the day and try to keep it. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I thought I would need to accumulate knowledge that could be helpful in performing tasks. That is why I am studying for an information security industry driver certificate to gain extensive and in-depth knowledge about security. I am also trying to think positively and try to be less stressed. Before that, if I was discouraged by the thought of 'Why can't I do it?' Now I think I will study more if I want to do this assignment. Even if it takes a while, I won't give up, so I will be able to do it.' I think the biggest achievement I made during my school year was in credit management. With my interest in security, I went to the Department of Security, but my first class was mainly focused on basic subjects such as English, mathematics, and science. After the first semester of the first year, I started taking programming classes related to my major for the first time in the second semester, and I performed the task of making a maze game until the end, showing my standard of penetration, and I got good grades. Since then, the fun of learning about the major has led me to follow the department class passionately, and my grades have been on the rise. As a result, the grades, which were only 3.5 in the first semester of the first year, were raised to 4.4 in the second semester of the second year, when the students began to take the security-intensive major. In the process, major classes were never present by proxy or absent, and I think it was important to try to communicate with my assistant or professor and solve problems that I did not know. I had a perception that the most important part was to build up my major knowledge that I thought was basic. So I was able to keep it for four years without giving up or neglecting it after working hard for a few semesters, and I can be proud that the constant effort is an outstanding achievement.""""I worked on a project to model the IP traceback technique in a class called Big Data Application Security. The project was divided into four areas: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena, and I was responsible for analyzing the correlation between IP header fields using R. The team formation was done randomly, but compared to other teams, the atmosphere at the beginning of our team was not passionate and individualistic play was strong. During the team meeting, we did not proactively present ideas or report detailed progress on the role, and we did not get any answers when we asked questions or opinions on the group chat room. At first, I planned to follow the lead if anyone had a friend, but I was embarrassed by the passive atmosphere. After doing my part to encourage the active participation of the team members, I organized the ip traceback technique and informed the team members of the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to tell them what was wrong. I also read the materials to be presented by other team members in advance and advised them on what to fix. As a result, the team members began to exchange opinions on the final outcome one by one, and shared their roles. As a result, I was able to get good grades in the team project and received compliments indirectly from other team members. At first, I was worried that the result of the project would be disgraceful compared to other teams, so I was able to lead the team and act as a mood maker for the first time in a project that I spent time on, and it was an experience where I felt proud through the changing atmosphere and progress of the team."" Since I was young, I have enjoyed playing RPG games, and my experiences of being hacked into my account at the time have led me to dream about becoming a security expert. After that, I went to a related department, and through my studies, I gained basic knowledge about it and security, and obtained the information processing industry engineer and information processing engineer certificates in order. After that, I participated in a two-month internship at a network security solution company to experience what I was doing at a real security company. I was interested in system security by participating in writing various vulnerability help, writing buffer overflow exploit reports, and writing articles on the latest security trends, and recently I prepared for an information security technician exam. As I was preparing for the exam, I became interested in monitoring the system through the security log and responding to violations, so I wanted to work for a general company rather than a security company. The decisive reason for applying for Webzen was that it was something I wanted to do normally after seeing an open recruitment announcement. In addition, if I work for a game company where young and passionate people gather in security, I think I will be able to come up with ideas to respond to new situations every day, and I will be able to breathe and enjoy myself in a free atmosphere."" ""I feel responsible for my duties and plans once, and I make sure to communicate clearly so that there is no misunderstanding in the communication process, and I try to make sure to know what I don't know for sure.During the winter vacation of the second semester of my second year, I slept less every day to achieve my goal and studied on my schedule, so I raised my TOEIC score by about 150 points in one month. When I started studying for a certificate, I was meticulous enough to read and read theoretical books two or three times to build up my foundation step by step, despite the reviews that I would pass if I solved the previous questions. Because of this personality, I don't like to go wrong or not finish my job, so I have taken on the job as much as I can and achieved good results. In addition, since I am not quick-witted in the communication process, I tend to ask questions and organize my thoughts and knowledge in order to understand the intention I want to convey at once. I participated in a firmware reverting study in my department's lab. At that time, it was a method of verbally conveying the progress of the study, but I wrote and presented what I had studied in the first hour in a good way that it looked good, and as a result, it was improved by generating presentation materials every week with good responses from study participants."",,,,"
"I became interested in security experts after I had several experiences of being hacked into game IDs and large portal sites that I enjoyed for neglecting account management in high school. After that, as I entered the security-related department, I was assigned to investigate security accidents, and I learned that there were many security accidents that started with the carelessness of the manager or neglected vulnerabilities. After that, I thought that applying the security theories obtained in the department class to real situations and checking for vulnerabilities fit well with my meticulous and principled personality, so I wanted to do something to manage the security system. KT recently had security accidents related to personal information leakage in 2012, 2014, and 2016, and I applied because I wanted to unfold my dreams and passion in the process of experiencing these accidents and growing into a stronger and safer company. Recently, I heard an article that concerns about security damage are circulating with the start of the Fourth Revolution. After joining the company, I want to aim to strengthen the security of products related to the iot service and AI industry. KT's latest artificial intelligence service called Giga Genie examines security issues that may arise from the introduction of speaker recognition technology, and in the long run, I would like to contribute to becoming a company with the image of 'Reliable KT' by applying a vulnerability check list that can be applied to other industrial products in the future. ""The challenge that I persevered with the most was to raise my language score. My first TOEIC score was about 560. The reason I studied TOEIC was to meet the lowest score to get a scholarship at school, and I had to score over 750 to be recognized until I graduated. I quit my private academy to start studying, but I applied without knowing it, and I ended up taking classes with students in the range of 700 points. At first, I couldn't attend the high-level classes and homework, so I couldn't even participate in the remaining studies and did homework at home. I couldn't meet my friends for the first month and slept for five to six hours a day because I had to do new homework every day and I had to do it on weekends. As a result of constantly making study plans and living according to the schedule, I was able to achieve much higher score than I wanted in two months because I was afraid that I would want to go off the mark for a day. Through this experience, I was able to break the stereotype that I have no connection with English, and I realized that no test can pass if I try hard. In addition, I don't think that getting a high score is just a story of others, but I have also become a habit of setting goals step by step and periodically checking progress to improve myself."" Last semester, I worked on a team project called Big Data Application Security to analyze big data attack logs and create simulations on how to detect ip spoofing. The project was conducted in a way that a group of four divided Python, R, Hadoop, and Arena into individual parts, and I was in charge of analyzing the correlation between the ip header fields extracted from a large number of logs using R. The goal was to acquire various tools through cooperation, but the initial team members did not pay attention to the other team members' parts, thinking, ""I need to do well in my part."" However, in the atmosphere of the group Kakaotalk Room where my friend in charge of Arena's part, who has not made progress for several weeks and no one is interested in it, I cycled the interim simulation made by the team member and gave feedback to activate the group Kakaotalk Room. Later, when the team member said to me, ""You seem to be the hardest working member among the team members,"" I felt proud, and the final presentation of our team was also well received. Through this experience, I learned that even if all the team members are passive, I can get a positive response by showing passion for even the smallest thing that I can help others."" ""The core competency I think is the ability to grasp the core when having work-related conversations with practitioners. First of all, in order to grasp the core, one must have basic knowledge as well as related terms as one's own. I was told by the professor who took the CISO position while taking the mobile swsecurity class last year, ""I am in the IT security department in actual work, but I can't talk because I don't know the basic terms."" And while working as an intern, I started studying for certificates on the advice of the head of the headquarters. I obtained the information processing technician license this year and am currently studying the information security technician license. It was good to be able to organize security terms that I learned for nearly four years while studying handwriting, and I am preparing for practical tests by running the security tools in the book and learning how to use each option. In addition, after two months of internship experience at a security company, I learned that I need to know rapidly changing security trends and new attack techniques to operate the system in response to them. I usually look at websites such as Security News, Daily Securities, and Anlab's latest security news to focus on the recent security accident news and new vulnerability analysis. This is helpful for obtaining certification in the short term, but in the long run, it is like having a meeting with team members or studying in advance what to do when operating other companies' security equipment in the event of a security accident, and I think it can be a small experience."""
"""My growth plate remains open."" I grew up thinking of 'growing' as the most important value of my life. What I'm referring to as 'growth' is the constant pursuit of new things. I've always loved solving math problems since I was young. But after solving a problem, even if the answer was correct, my method of solving and the method of solving the answer sheet were always different. It was interesting to me that one problem has many solutions. So it has become a habit to learn new solutions, make them my own, and think about whether there is another solution in various ways. I don't think this is limited to math problems. If you approach an issue in the same way, you can lose ways of thinking in various ways, which is an obstacle to your growth. So I don't settle down to the old way, but always pursue new things and make progress. And 'growth' is about listening to other people's voices at the same time as constantly pursuing new things. When there is a problem, no matter how many ways you think alone, there are limits and sometimes it is hard to get out of bigotry. I don't hesitate to accept and adopt other people's opinions. You may think that this blurs your subjectivity, but I don't think so at all. Rather, I think that through other people's thoughts, you can discover your shortcomings and improve them so that you can have a clearer subjectivity. I am also confident that this nourishes your growth, and furthermore, it will help your team grow. I think this tendency is also consistent with the vision that LINE pursues. ""I think LINE and I will be partners who can create the best synergy effect."" ""There is no game that you can't make with passion."" During this summer vacation, I created a mobile game while working in a joint development club called OOOOOO. Our team of three developers and two designers created a game called ""OOOOOOO Galaxy."" You can earn coins through three mini-games and purchase new fidget spinners with the coins. As a developer, I made one mini-game, and I participated in some of the store system and game balancing. The development tools used Unity2D and C# scripts. In this game, I used NGUI, Unity's representative and powerful UI system, and an asset called LeanTween, which can effectively animate. Implementing the game UI and animation has little to do with the game's core logic, but it takes a lot of time to implement it properly. However, I used the aforementioned assets to effectively reduce the time, and was able to focus more on implementing the core logic of the game. Meanwhile, one of the developers went out for personal reasons. And I took over the part that the person who left was developing. At first, I thought it would be easy to continue making it because it was already made to some extent, but it was a big mistake. The style of coding with me is completely different, and most of all, there was no annotation, so it was very difficult to understand the code. So, I tried to code in my own style from the beginning, but only refer to the existing code for parts that were difficult to implement. It was a long process. But I couldn't delay time because I had work that I'd done before, and I didn't mind staying up all night. As a result, I was able to catch up to what I had done before in two days. And in my mini-game, certain objects had to be created and destroyed more than 10 times per second. But in the process, there was a lot of throughput, which caused the game to stutter. So I solved it by creating objects only at the beginning of the scene, and reusing them all. There were many other difficulties, but I also referenced the Scripting API on the official Unity website and solved them through active communication among team members. As a result, I completed the game within a period of time and was selected as an excellent work by the club. It has now been uploaded to the Google Play Store. My experience like this will be very helpful for me to work at LINE."",""""Game Developer, who truly loves games."" My experience of passion and dedication was working on the game development team at OOO, a university game club. After I was discharged from the military, there was a period of skepticism and lethargy about my department. At a time when I wasn't sure what to do, I joined a game club just because I liked games. And there I met some game-loving classmates. I had a lot of fun. All the club activities were playing games together and talking about games, but I was amazed at how lively I was. So I thought, ""Let's do something by combining it with what I like, not just feel skeptical about academic work."" After that, people who were interested in game development gathered in the club and formed a game development team. It was the beginning of my game development career. The initial game development team of 7-8 people started by conducting game-related seminars every week. I prepared and participated in seminars on various topics related to development, further developing my passion for game development. That was only a year ago. Over time, the scale of the game development team grew, and last winter vacation, we divided into three teams and produced games for each team (see portfolio). However, our team was at a loss because everything was our first time. So we got together every day to discuss countermeasures, and I studied about the Unity engine. I learned much faster than I did before when I was learning my major at school. I knew that at this point.That programming is not about studying ""to become a programmer"" but ""because I have something to make."" And despite having to do everything from learning necessary knowledge to producing for two months, I was able to launch a game that I had planned. I think I can do anything with my love and passion for these games. Although I'm not sure I'm better than any other developer when it comes to development expertise. But I have more pure passion than anyone else. It started with my passion and need, and in a short period of time, I created something from nothing. I'm all set to play a role as a game developer at LINE,,,"
"""We Make a Trend"" The start-up club ""TrenData,"" which was founded to create a new trend with a convergent mind, conducted weekly trend seminars and found start-up ideas. The weekly trend was an activity to research, present, and discuss trends in ICT technology and market issues and changes. In addition, based on the trend presented by students from various departments, we tried to analyze market problems and present a new paradigm to the market with a start-up mind. Through trend presentation and idea discovery activities conducted for more than a year, I was able to quickly learn the changing trend of the ICT market. In addition, all club members presented and created new ideas together, rather than devising ideas with their own thoughts through discussion and ID discovery activities based on the published data. Based on these club activities, it was an opportunity to challenge the start-up of a business under the theme of Some: See O2O service by converging ICT technology and culture and arts with the award of four contests, and creating a new market by utilizing public data."""""" -Overview The public data analysis and visualization platform based on big data, also known as GView, which won the Excellence Award in July 2014, is a platform that enhances convenience so that not only experts but also the general public can find and visualize the value of data among countless public data. -Proposed Background In line with the opening of public data, which is the core strategy of the government 3.0, GView proposed to develop a big data analysis/visualization platform to create a platform that can analyze big data that was not easily accessible. In the existing market, when analysis data was needed, big data analysis companies and data scientists mainly analyzed the data needed. However, this idea was proposed to break the existing market framework and come up with a way to easily analyze data even for ordinary people who do not have expertise."" ""This idea focused on two keywords: analysis and visualization. The core elements of data analysis technology are Hadoop and Hadoop Echo systems that can handle large amounts of data. These technologies have grown and developed rapidly with the advent of big data. The technology of the big data industry is continuously growing as it is used by world-famous companies such as Google and FaceBook. At the same time as saying, ""The era of big data has arrived,"" many companies are doing many businesses using big data, and the economic profit generation is also increasing every year. The idea was to process a large amount of unstructured data that had not been processed so far by using Hadoop, which is the core of these big data analysis technologies. In addition, in the field of visualization, 'how to show the data' to the user was selected as an important keyword. To make it easier for customers to understand the analyzed data, the data visualization tools such as Weka, R, and SPSS were used to communicate information effectively using charts and various visualization means. Through this plan, we wanted to provide an opportunity for users to analyze the research activity index they want with simple data input and gain new insights within it.""���,,,"
"""Would you like to collaborate with KT and my passion?"" The motivation for applying for this job is in line with my interests. Currently, KT is starting a new trend by introducing the artificial intelligence TV GiGA Genie. I think this is a huge advantage. Most household appliances in Korea are TVs. Therefore, it is possible to use multiple IoT services efficiently by using AI TVs with high accessibility. In addition, after participating in the Seoul Motor Show in March, we linked GiGA Genie to the car and demonstrated vehicle control through AI-based voice recognition such as remote start-up and location guidance. As such, KT is changing our daily lives with rapid momentum through the AI field. I was also interested in AI field and gained experience and knowledge in it through my studies and projects. So I applied because I thought it was more suitable than anyone else for this job. And I thought that KT's best-skilled employees will be the support group for the development of professionals, so I thought I could realize my vision and grow together. After joining KT, I will first develop basic job competencies and become GIGA-level newcomers in the SW development profession. After joining the company, I will build up my expertise in deep learning by building solid basic knowledge for five years. I will develop the ability to quickly solve any problems by running around and studying or attending conferences by building deep knowledge. In 10 years, I will create various ideas and skills that KT's services can connect with people anywhere.""""Learn responsibility and cooperation""Team project leaders need to be responsible and cooperative. I learned that when I joined an academic club at a university. I gathered with my friends who had a lot of things to learn, studied, and helped them to know each other, thereby building knowledge. I went to a household appliance contest to broaden my horizons. I aimed to make laundry management APP with NFC function according to my team members and the theme. So, I made it possible for users to check the laundry guidelines with the Yahoo weather API. And accordingly, I could set the laundry timer. As I was working on the project, I planned the schedule as the leader and coordinated with the team members. However, in the previous experience, there was a short production period and a problem of having to create ideas and functions for the school project. So, we divided the roles based on the areas that the team members were good at and revised and supplemented the schedule to resolve any problems. As a result, the project received favorable reviews. So, I was able to intern for three months and learned a lot of experience. After that, I took the position of the head of the school in the club, and I was able to win the Best Team in SW activities as I continued to work with the project. Through this experience, I gained a sense of responsibility while being a leader, and I understood that teamwork toward goals is important in the project. With this sense of responsibility and the spirit of collaboration with the team members, I will make a service for everyone at KT."",""""Energy Hackathon: Learn Passion"" I went out to the hackathon and showed my passion without giving up even when I encountered time limits. Through the energy Hackathon, I was able to check the electricity usage at home in advance with a smartphone, so that I could create an energy-saving APP that could plan the use of electricity. However, since a lot of technology has already been developed, people around us gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use from a user perspective, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather thought of what they still have difficulty with and what the blind are uncomfortable with. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who cannot use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the gold used by voice according to the power they currently use. I made the Android part and let the team members use each API to make it. We divided the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. As a result, more than half of smartphone users in their 30s and 60s were evaluated to be able to easily understand how much they consumed in terms of money through the service, prevent indiscriminate power consumption, and prevent loss of money for individual families, and received the Energy Hackathon. So, I learned that the results of development after thinking about the customers' minds can be more efficient. In the future, I will join KT with a village for users and try to complete it without giving up despite many difficulties. In order to produce the ""Challenge Spirit and Machine Learning"" project, it is necessary to make efforts to find and study new technologies in person. Such thoughts are due to the experience I gained while conducting a contest with my friend in college. For the contest, I aimed to produce a program that made it easy to recognize, store, and modify the score. So, I wanted to give convenience to those who use guitar through the program. To this end, I worked hard on planning and production for 3 months with my friend, but I couldn't get a prize in the end. The reason is that the guitar codes in the sheet music in the image have a low recognition rate. This is because the sheet music image lacks recognition depending on the slope or shadow. Through this, I felt that machine learning was necessary, and I learned other codes by using open source tessellation ocr. After learning about each guitar code, the recognition rate definitely increased. Through these efforts, I tried to improve the project and challenged the contest again. As a result, I was awarded the best team in the OOSW contest and experienced firsthand whether many people were interested in machine learning along with the new knowledge of machine learning. With this opportunity, I studied AI on my own and held a seminar in front of more than 20 students on the subject I studied. It was a special experience to solve problems by studying and using new technologies that I only saw as news articles.Through this active thought and continuous skill acquisition, we will change the world with KT."",,,,"
"[Write it big] I chose Samsung Electronics to go to the place called 'Dream' because the first thing that people in many countries think of is 'Samsung' when they think of Korea. Many young overseas students still carry cell phones with Samsung logo on them. When I saw Samsung on the donation list of the British Museum during my trip to Europe, I felt that it was Samsung that made many activities and donations from all over the world. As such, I wanted to join Samsung and make many innovative products to publicize the country and entertain many people. Also, working for Samsung, a place with the world's best technology and value that contributes to Korea's many developments, is helpful for national development and overcoming the crisis. The name 'OO' means that I will use it big, not replace it. Just like the name, I will become a master of IoT in 10 years. Just as Samsung developed ARTIK for IoT, in 10 years, we will provide convenience and pleasure to all products as well as autonomous cars, smart watches, and smart homes can be connected to customers. I believe that the greatest reward of developers is to make customers happy with the results they have made. After joining the company, Samsung Electronics will make everyone in the world edgy...""[Living the same way as yesterday and expecting a different future is like getting sick] Einstein said. In other words, whatever you aim for, you should not lose your passion and work hard. My goal is to make products for everyone in the world. I had this goal when I joined Samsung Software Membership at the recommendation of my seniors in college. As my seniors recommended, I was able to gather with friends who had a lot to learn from, study hard, and help each other gain a broader perspective and knowledge. One of the most memorable things in my membership was the Samsung project conducted by the home appliance business department. To make washing machines in the home more efficiently, I want to create an app for NFC function and a prototype that efficiently provides users with a laundry guide and notification system for current weather. I felt a sense of responsibility for the work as I worked with the idea of making products for actual customers, from project proposals to prototype programs. Afterwards, I felt like I wanted to make products convenient for people, and I promised to study for a lot of my major knowledge. Samsung also aims to provide a 'better world' to its customers. I want to join Samsung, which has the same goal and dreams of the future as me, and grow into a programmer who will change the world. So, I have continued to develop my two strengths to provide products to customers with stable and high satisfaction. First, I have a lot of experience in IT-related activities. I participated in various internship programs and hackathon related to IT to achieve the grand prize by showing my creativity. In addition, I was awarded the certificate as an outstanding team for Samsung S/W activities by demonstrating my leadership as the head of an academic club, and gained an excellent IT knowledge in an academic competition on campus. Through this, I learned the importance of passion for my goals and was not afraid of failure. These experiences can create rapid organizational convergence and synergy after joining the company. Second, strong DB knowledge. Data base is an important technology that goes into every program. This is because we need to build a DB to have information even if it is a small program and use it again. I felt that this DB was important, so I studied and acquired the OCP certificate. And based on this, I created a POS system using Oracle. While studying in the DB lab, I studied how to develop it to become a safe program. While producing this program, I became more confident about DB production. This IT knowledge will help to increase the safety of production programs. With this potential, we are trying to become a talented person who can present our vision to the company in the future. We will continue to cultivate these strengths to become one that changes the world at Samsung."",""[Unmanned cars and deep learning] Currently, many companies around the world are interested in autonomous cars and are investing in development. Tesla CEO Elon Must said that he would complete the preparation for commercialization of autonomous cars in September 2018. And Google, Toyota, and Hyundai cars are also investing a lot in developing these technologies. Watching these news, I was curious and interested in how such technologies could be made, and while studying artificial intelligence myself, I learned how to solve problems with the power of collective intelligence with a lot of information. And in Hong Kong, it was found that by dividing the subway maintenance time into a timetable through deep learning, the work efficiency was increased by 30%. And Google or YouTube extracts feature points with each image and video and creates the information that the user wants again. And Facebook automatically finds and creates relational data that allows you to find facial features and create names or know your relationships with others when you upload a picture. I think this development of deep learning will lead to another IT innovation. Already, Korea has the world's best Internet and smartphone penetration rate, but the platform to lead the market has not been completed. If the platform is established, I believe that building the ecosystem of the Internet of Things will eliminate the limited types of products and their range of use. In addition, deep learning technology will be absolutely necessary to provide services to products. This is because the amount of information we can have will gradually increase in the future.Through this, I think it will be common to collect information with big data, process it with deep learning, and then help people through the Internet of Things (IoT). More broadly, I think businesses can be created and jobs can be created in many new fields."",,,,"
"""Change the world through music."" I think songs are a big part of people's lifestyle. I am constantly interested in music such as Superstar K, Produce 101, and The Masked Singer. Such interest is spreading Korea around the world through K-pop. Bugs provides the largest sound source in Korea through various platforms in high quality. Therefore, I think working at Bugs Music, the best of music services, is a development and rewarding job in Korea. I am trying to change the world with IT with the idea of SMART and CREATIVE to join Bugs. While working as an intern, I built a web service that records and manages personalized services as My To Do. Although there are many TODO services, many people currently create a lot of things to do through job studies, but we tried to solve the inconvenience of not sharing their schedules due to spatial constraints by creating a TODO list. And I started with the mindset of actually producing using everything I learned. I started production using Spring Boot, and DB used MySQL. And I applied Nested Results for Collection with the Mapper from MyBatis. And I used Jenkins for CI to make continuous management easier. And I wrote a cleaner code using coding conversion, and I made UnitTest test the code for the service sector. And I tried to make the service sector more secure by using transactions. Unlike students, in practice, a project is not one alone, but several people. So I think we need someone who has experience in CI and thinks about algorithms and safe codes. Even if I join Bugs in the future, I will be an applicant who writes while thinking about even one line of code.""""Ui/UX, RADSONE"" The reason I think so is that when the phone was a 2G phone, and when the computer was before Windows XP, they all used letters and keyboards like Lizz. However, the concept of a mouse was created, and you can intuitively see it by clicking and dragging. This was not just a UI/UX conversion, but an increase in usability and increased intuition. As such, I use my iPhone during the Bugs service, and unlike other services, if I press the category button, I can see it in a checkerboard format right away. So I think the good thing about Bugs is that it is easy to find other functions while using it. Another good thing about Bugs is its RADSONE technology. Anyone who finds and listens to music will want to hear it more vividly with a better sound. Also, there are times when you want to listen to a specific instrument better, or you want to pay the most attention to the vocals. Bugs provides a total of four sound modes and has the largest FLAC sound source in Korea. Therefore, I think the service that shows superior strength in sound quality is better than anywhere else. ""In the case of Bugs service, it is not distinguished by LTE/WIFI, but by setting it as streaming, there is an inconvenience that the sound quality must be continuously changed depending on the communication environment. "" If you don't think too much about sound quality, you can set it to the AAC+ low-capacity format. I think this is a disadvantage in the WIFI environment because when you want to listen to high-quality music, you have to change the music format every time the communication network changes. However, there is a music storage function as a countermeasure. If you have enough storage space, you can download music to your device and play music without using data. However, I think this is a disadvantage because this alternative method is difficult because the capacity is small when using a 16G iPhone like me.""- TODO Personalization Service 1) duration: 2016.12 ~ 2017.02 2) Key details: Establishment of a web service that records and manages personalization service 'My Halil.' 3) What I contributed: Development of servers based on Spring Framework 4) Skill or Knowledge: Spring Boot, MySQL, MyBatis, JSP, Jackie, J Unit, Jenkins 5) Result/Performance: Development process experience, production of Java-based web environment. - 2016 Energy Hackathon 1) Progress period: 2016.02) Main contents: Producing an energy-saving APP that can be used by checking electricity usage in advance 3) Contributing points: APP Developing an APP or Knowledge: Google TTS, Newtone API, EnerTalk API, Android, JAVA 5) Results/Performance: Grand Prize Winner - 15 years (prize) OO Development Capability Evaluation 1) Progressive contents: 2015.08.25 2) Main contents: Algorithm solution 3) Self-contributing points during software membership activities: Skills or knowledge: BFS, DFS, data structure, C, JAVA 5) Results/Performance: Acquiring intermediate (AM) grade - Participating in app production and research of OO Electronics' home appliance business (Smart Washer APP) 1) Progressive contents: Participating in the production of APP by OO Electronics' home appliance business in the first half of 2015 - Participating in the production of APP by OO Electronics' home appliance business in the first half of 2015 3) Contributing points: Producing washing machine information and data usage applications using NFC. 4) Skill or knowledge used: Android application production, DB connection, and weather API were used. 5) Results/achievements: favorable reviews during the internship process, experience in the development process, experience in implementing various Android functions - Other learning APP development through score recognition 1) Progress period: 2014.05~2014.082 Main content: When a user takes a picture of the desired score through video processing or selects it from the album, the appropriate guitar code is automatically generated, the accompaniment is played according to the code, and you can check how to pronounce the code. 3) What I contributed to: Making the Android part.

"""Important Value I Learned in a Hard Time"" When I just entered middle school, my family was very difficult due to the bankruptcy of my father's company. My parents were busy, and my sister was a high school student, so it was just my brother and I until 10 o'clock. Even though I was young, I thought that there was no one to protect my house except me, so I came back home right after school. I naturally learned responsibility and understanding by eating with my younger brother and sharing cleaning. Thanks to this, I was able to build a smooth teamwork by sometimes taking on the role of a responsible leader and sometimes a strong colleague during the project. ""How to succeed through challenge"" My biggest strength is the courage to challenge. When I was in high school, I was afraid to stand in front of people due to trauma. Rather, I thought that if I stand in front of more people, I will be able to overcome my fear, so I applied for the National Singing Contest. As a result, I failed, but I was not as afraid of standing in front of people as I used to be. After that, I learned how to succeed by challenging and failing whenever my fear was ahead of me. When it comes to network operation, I will become a talented person who leads innovation through various attempts. ""Checklist for meticulousness"" On the other hand, the downside is that I lack meticulousness in handling tasks. During my internship, I made a mistake of misspelling documents. Reflecting on my inability to check thoroughly, I made a list that I must check when writing documents. Afterwards, I got into the habit of following the checklist before submitting documents, and I was able to reduce my mistakes. After joining the company, I will make my own checklist and try to handle it meticulously. ""When I was in college, one of the games that I was responsible for my enjoyment was """"Tiny Farm."" Whenever I turned on the game, I used to feel good by coming across the logo with Com2u's unique smile on it. In order to give users constant pleasure, the story and cute characters of the game are important, but I think it is most important to provide seamless service. I applied to provide enjoyable game services to users who use Com2uS. My biggest advantage is that I can handle both network and script language at the same time. When the network is not large, it is not a big problem even if I check the equipment one by one and deal with the failure. However, there is a limit to operating the network manually when the size of the game increases and the number of games served increases. We will automate network operations step by step through the development of scripting capabilities, which is an advantage. Through this, we will try to make the network a solid foundation for Com2uS' business expansion in the future."""" ""I have three months of internship experience working at a network company."" During the internship, I monitored network networks around the world and learned basic troubleshooting, ip management, and impact management from work. By analyzing complex topologies, I learned the components of the network such as routing protocols, vlan, and ip, and learned security policies such as filter and acl. It also increased our understanding of network redundancy and improved stability through the structure of vrrp, glb, and spin-leaf. In addition to simply interpreting the created network, I have experience in designing and implementing the network myself. In gns3, we implemented a network connecting three as using Juniper and Cisco equipment. We used bgp, ospf, and static routing protocols, and we checked that the two hosts at the end communicate with each other through routing tables and ping tests. We can also handle script languages such as shellscript, java, c language, python. While we were working on it, we implemented a passwordless ssh connection through shellscript. After embedding the password in the script using the expect script, we made it enter the password automatically when we tried the ssh connection, and the result was successful. We will use these scripts to drive the automation of our operations to increase the efficiency of our network operations."",,"
"""Important Value I Learned in a Hard Time"" When I just entered middle school, my family was very difficult due to the bankruptcy of my father's company. Since my parents were busy and my sister was a high school student, it was just me and my sister until 10 o'clock. Even though I was young, I thought, ""There is no one to protect my home except me,"" so I came back home right after school. I naturally learned responsibility and understanding by eating meals with my younger brother and sharing the cleaning process. As a result, I was able to build a smooth teamwork by sometimes taking on the role of a responsible leader and sometimes a reliable colleague during the project. ""The power to overcome fear, challenge"" There was one trauma to me. When I was in elementary school, I was elected as the class president because of my friend's joke, but I was eliminated after receiving only four votes. The shame I felt at that time was hurt when I was young, and when I stood in front of the audience, my whole body trembled and I couldn't speak well. This personality affected me until the beginning of middle and high school, and when other friends focused on my presentation, my whole body would tremble less without realizing it. To overcome this, I applied to show off my best friend and the national song. To prevent me from getting nervous, I covered my face with a scarf and even put on sunglasses. I sang ""My Accidental Accident"" with the choreography in front of more than 500 people, and I proudly failed. However, there were audiences who laughed at the performance, and it was a fun stage for me as well. Through this, I learned how to overcome trauma and enjoy being nervous. There were several times when I was nervous when I took the SAT or when I presented a project, but I used to get better results than when I practiced. To overcome a problem, it is my philosophy of life to confront it head-on. I will develop myself by bumping and breaking it, and fully absorb what I have realized. ""Up my professionalism with concentration"" My biggest strength is that I have good concentration. When I fall into one thing, I often fall into it so that I can't see my surroundings well. When I was an undergraduate, there was a project that soldered to form a circuit, and I had the experience of finishing soldering in just one day. Thanks to this, I was able to focus more on coding projects afterwards. This personality will contribute to developing my expertise in InnoWireless, and further developing the company's technology. I will concentrate better than anyone else, saving time to eat and working on developing skills. ""A ""perfectionist"" One of my biggest weaknesses is that I try to complete every little thing perfectly. In my fourth year of college, I had time to take a mock interview and fill out a survey at a job center. At that time, other classmates answered simply within a line, but I wrote down everything I felt and the basic line was over three to four lines. The problem took that much longer and all the classmates had to wait for me to finish. I repeatedly understood that I was in a ""simple deficit"" due to their stinging eyes, but I was finally able to let go of my pen when I was done speaking. This was helpful for the development of the job center, but it could hurt the feelings of my classmates. Later, I regained my relationship with them, saying, ""I'm sorry to have kept you waiting."" I will work hard for the company, but I will maintain good relationships with seniors, colleagues, and juniors who work together with my unique knuckles and closeness. ""One complete product made by 10 errors"" I have experience producing ""Smart CCTV"" through Raspberry Pi and C language design during my undergraduate years. Since it is inefficient for a person to control CCTV 24 hours a day, we have implemented a function of self-judging a dangerous situation, informing the manager, and recording the video. First, connect the Raspberry Pi with the camera and then perform image processing using an open CV. When an object approaches, the image processing result is notified to the main server and the video is sent. In this process, I took charge of socket communication between Raspberry Pi and the main server and took the role of implementing it in C language. We designed with Raspberry Pi as a client and the team member's laptop as a server, and used TCP/IP protocol. We used WLAN (WIFI) and gstreamer for video streaming. It was successful to connect the server and the client, but there was a problem with video streaming. After the screen was displayed for 2-3 seconds, the program stopped with memory-related errors. To solve the problem, I looked up books about open CV and gstream in the library, and I even got advice from people I study with. As a result of my efforts, I found that I only imported the video from the while door that fetched the frame and did not release it. As a result, memory shortages occurred and the program was terminated. Later, by releasing variables, I was able to solve the memory shortage problem. When I work, I believe that there will be more errors than successful ones in the development process. I will read and grasp the company's previous development documents carefully to correct these errors, and become a new employee who develops by listening to seniors more precious than ever before. I found InnoWireless very attractive in three aspects: ""Aptitude, vision, and corporate culture."" The first is aptitude. As an engineering student, I had a high interest in network development to the extent that I studied communications on my own. It is a dream of mine since I was an undergraduate school to strive to develop next-generation communication technologies such as CDMA, WCDMA, and small cell at InnoWireless. To this end, I am ready to do not mind high-intensity work or overtime. The second is the vision of the company. Under the vision of being a world-class company, InnoWireless is investing boldly in technology development rather than immediate big profits. For example, he was selected as a small cell supplier for telecommunications companies and became the first in the world to commercialize small cell technology, proving the high technological prowess of the company.We decided that it is a company that has the power to leap to become a world-class company through the virtuous cycle of investment, technological improvement, and value-added creation. The third is the corporate culture. I believe that the characteristics of InnoWireless's corporate culture are 'fairness' and 'emphasis on talent'. Above all, I felt that it was a well-motivated environment for self-development in that it provided specific standards and compensation for judging performance. In addition, I was able to feel the careful consideration of developers as welfare benefits for the operation of dormitories, provision of meals and healthcare. Through these three things, I applied as I thought we could grow together in mutual trust.""""Three Promises for Growth Recently, mobile operators are not only seeking to expand coverage but also to improve service quality through efficient management of surging data traffic. To this end, they are making great efforts to develop new technologies and secure frequencies. I believe that one of the technologies that should be supported in order to develop these new technologies is OAM technology for wireless networks. After joining the company, I will try to secure the best OAM technology in Korea. First, I will adapt to my work by listening to the seniors' bitter words. I think what is much more valuable than learning through books is the words of seniors who come into contact with practical work. I will write down this carefully and find my own manual that I look for whenever I get stuck in my work. Second, I will try to acquire new skills by reading ten professional books a year to improve my professionalism. Europe's network technology is one step ahead of Korea's. I will study how to acquire advanced knowledge through original texts and papers and add them to the company's technology at all times. Third, I will work hard on the education of juniors. I think that for sustainable development, consistent training of juniors should be carried out. When all four wheels of a car run together, a car can move forward. For the development of InnoWireless, I will listen to the seniors and work hard to cultivate juniors below."""
"[Importance of collaboration with other companies] I was interested in the database field, so I took the 'Big Data Manager' course organized by the IT Business Promotion Association of Korea as well as the department class and carried out projects such as Java programming and data architecture design. While working on the project with students from various departments, I was able to hear various opinions on things that I did not think of or missed. I think that cooperation with other companies is important as well as the company's technology. Samsung has affiliates in the fields of electronics, finance, and heavy industry. Collaboration with the former and the financial sector can increase the competitiveness of the service and create synergies. In addition, Samsung Electronics is actively promoting cooperation with foreign companies such as the U.S. and Europe, so I applied because I thought there was a great potential for development. My dream at Samsung Electronics is to become the first in the world share of the program I made. I think a good program should be able to easily use the functions that the user needs. While programming, I always thought about the user's position.""[What Mathematics Problem Solving and Programming have in common] I have liked solving math problems since I was young. No matter how difficult a problem was, the process of solving it by substituting basic formulas and principles felt enjoyable, and this was the reason why I chose the natural world and chose engineering when I went to college. However, object-oriented programming that I took in my first year of college felt different from solving math problems. The screen in English felt like a different language, and I didn't think there would be rules. So, I went to the military with poor grades in the first grade programming subject, and while I was taking classes related to programming, I was forced to take a course called system programming due to failure in registration. It was a class that I entered belatedly, so I often visited the professor to ask for a class registration and to ask questions about the previous class, and this led me to focus on the class. What I felt while learning the C language in the system programming subject was similar to solving a math problem. Code, which I thought was just a list of English words, had a rule, and the process of using the rule to output the desired result value was as interesting as solving a math problem. The fact that I had to spend a lot of time to find single letter mistakes, minor mistakes in the use of phrases, and the fact that external problems other than code problems occurred sometimes felt difficult, but all of these processes gave me an opportunity to improve my programming skills. Since then, I became interested in programming and had a dream of becoming a developer. [How to work together in a strange job] I took a leave of absence to go on a trip to Europe, which was my dream since I was a third grader at university. And I immediately worked for two months at the Samsung Semiconductor Research Institute in Suwon to save money. At first, I was very tired from unfamiliar work, and it was even more difficult to work with strangers all day long. I didn't go home, but lived in a lodging house, so I had to wait more than an hour for me to wash up after work, and I just felt uncomfortable going to bed. However, the more I worked, the more enjoyable my team members who were close to each other, and I envied the more they were recognized for completing and taking responsibility for the work. So from the next day, I went first, talked to him, hung out, and if there was anything I didn't know, I started first, and tried to ask him exactly. When I opened up, it didn't take long for us to get to know each other. Since then, the work has become a little more enjoyable and I have felt a lot of rewarding like never before. No matter what kind of work I do, I have found that if I have a good relationship with the person I work with, I can work more happily and the efficiency of my work increases. Since then, whenever I want to achieve my goals by collaborating with someone, I have always tried to maintain a good relationship with people."",""[Big Data Analysis and Prediction] Among the recent social issues, the issues that I am interested in are big data analysis and prediction. Big data prediction is the prediction of what is most likely to occur statistically based on the collected data. As the analysis and prediction of unstructured data such as SNS and reviews increase, as well as structured data, many areas are used, many issues arise regarding big data analysis. The first is the accuracy of big data prediction. In order to increase the accuracy of big data, I believe that individual analysis and prediction are as important as those of a large number of people. Unlike in the past, when similar people gathered to work, individual diversity of people is respected as people with diverse thoughts gathered to create synergy. In big data analysis, it will be more important to make predictions by analyzing a person's consumption patterns, hobbies, and eating habits rather than by analyzing a large number of people of similar age and place of residence. Rather than analyzing a large number of data unconditionally, I think it is necessary to provide a prediction service tailored to each individual through various aspects of analysis. I think cooperation with other companies is necessary because it is necessary to collect user data through various routes. The second issue is the invasion of privacy in big data analysis. In this regard, I believe that strengthening the security of data should be prioritized. The value of data is increasing because big data prediction tends to increase in accuracy as the number of data increases. However, if data that you do not want to be collected is collected and used for analysis in the process of collecting data, you may think it is an invasion of privacy. That is why I think we need to strengthen the security of our data."",,,,"
"I have been exercising ever since I was young. I won several awards at the Gyeonggi Taekwondo Competition when I was in elementary and middle school, and won the club wrestling competition when I was in high school. Through my athletic career, I learned the lifestyle of robbing and waking up quickly even if I failed, and also the open personality to live a harmonious life with any organization or members. Based on my personality, I took the position of general manager or team leader in various projects such as government projects and contests, and put a lot of effort into harmony and synergy with my team members. As a result, I was awarded the Excellence Award in various competitions, and even after the project was over, I met them periodically, and became an opportunity to make essential colleagues in my college life."" When I was in the 2nd and 3rd grades, I was teaching at the school's practice room and setting and managing the development environment on about 200 classroom computers every semester. I joined a development company in Seocho, Seoul, based on my experience teaching myself after seeing my junior do an Android app that felt distant. I developed push alarms and banner image parsing functions, and documented the functions I was in charge of. It was an experience where I could see and learn many things, including not only my major knowledge, but also the leadership that the development team leader leads the team, and how development proceeds in practice. Fortunately, I gathered three key talents and formed a team within the university. I participated in the OO competition as a team leader and developed and operated as a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) as a project planning, management, and backend developer. In addition, I led the same team and participated in the ~~ competition, and received two Excellence Awards at the end of the year."",""""While taking the composition class, I still felt that musicians had more discomfort than I thought."" I think this applies not only to musicians. Based on my technological prowess, I want to become an appropriate technology developer through understanding and empathy in various fields. For this goal, I have the following career development. First, I plan to challenge the first-class Linux master test. I think it will be a great help for TIMEX software, a powerhouse in the domestic middleware market. Second, I will achieve win-win development among colleagues by conducting a study. I have experience in organizing algorithm studies with the support of the in-school teaching and learning support center and improving the ability of the study team members as the team leader. Based on this experience, I want to achieve win-win development with members. Third, I plan to do various community activities. Many seniors and professors say in unison that not only technical skills but also understanding and empathy in the field make better programs. As an engineering student, I would like to use my experience of minor in composition to contribute to the Tmax R&D business from a broad perspective."", I worked on the project by learning one by one through the introductory Linux book and Googling, even though I was not aware of the server's owner.

"Among the usual convenience store businesses, GS Retail's convenience store had a positive image as it was the most cost-effective store. Even if you buy a triangular kimbap, other companies only offer discounts on the price of drinks, but GS25 gave you small joys such as gifts. Seeing how they studied the taste, cost-effectiveness, and trend of lunch boxes and fresh foods through the FF research center, I was deeply impressed by GS Retail's craftsmanship, which focuses on quality rather than marketing and advertising. ""I found that I enjoy learning new technologies that I had no idea about or am interested in in in the computer engineering department. When I first got a smartphone in my freshman year, it was a shock like a new world. So, I wanted to create a program that I could use on my smartphone, so I looked for courses in C language, Java, and Android lectures and app, Inventor courses at universities. Not satisfied with it, I wanted to experience how apps were developed in a working environment, so I went to the suburbs to give lectures on Android by the KISA and field trips at start-up companies. The experience of making my own in-depth Android knowledge and experience, such as parsing, DB management, market upload, profitable marketing skills, gave me interest, vitality, and fun in the IT industry. Beyond learning these new technologies, the movement that aims for application will not stop even after I join the company."" After joining GS Retail, I want to work in the IT mobile department, which will benefit from my experience as a college student. When I saw the GS25 app currently on the market, I had original ideas such as refrigerator and point accumulation, but it really hurt me to see that many customers gave me 1 out of 5 stars when installing the app, because they required too much authority, used too many resources, and had frequent errors. If I join the company, I would like to create an edge browser instead of Explorer, which will perform better, and take the example of how I could ignore legacy codes that I have followed since the old version, and develop the app from scratch to optimize and stabilize functions so that it can function smoothly regardless of which customer's smartphone is. This is because stability and scalability are indispensable elements in websites, apps, and programs.""""I think my strength is the affinity I gained through various challenges and experiences. I didn't have this competitive edge to start with. After failing to retake the job, I was so clumsy that I was rejected as a part-time job seeker. So I thought I needed to change, so I applied for a theater club where I communicated with the audience with my whole body. In addition, I decided that I needed skills to socialize with people of various characteristics, so I gained a lot of experience by applying for the Marine Corps. Now, I can approach anyone and continue the conversation, and I can freely express my opinion. What needs to be corrected is concentration. As I couldn't sit for a long time and my grades dropped until the first semester of my third year, I recruited study personnel to attend the library and certify my study time, thereby creating motivation to focus. In addition, I successfully received an A+ in my major subject for the first time after making efforts to pack two meals for efficient time management."" ""My experience of learning the power of honesty was when I participated as a mentor at a basic educational center on campus. The goal was to improve the academic ability of first-year students who could not complete required liberal arts courses. At that time, I had a lot of learning ahead of my senior year, so I could start preparing for mentoring at 2 a.m. But one of my juniors told me that sometimes they only met one mentor, took a certified photo, and received the support fee without a single class. However, my ethical value is, 'Always be proud of yourself,' and I never intended to break it just for convenience. So I thought about how to teach them efficiently in a short period of time, and organized and taught them what I needed to learn in my senior year in high school, TOEIC, and TOEIC Speaking. As a result, I got first place in my special semester test. From this experience, I have deeply learned that honest efforts can overcome challenges no matter how hard they are."",,,,"
"[Start of Communication] The values in life are 'Let's communicate.' These values were formed from the time I was in elementary school. I served as the president when I was in the fourth grade. I started communicating with the teacher by giving her suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and delivered her words to her friends as well. Through this, I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class and finish the school year without any accidents. Through these experiences, I learned the importance of communication, and I was able to further improve my communication skills by serving as the president in the fifth, sixth, and middle schools. [Clear after Rain] In 2015, I had an experience of breaking through the competition ratio of 21:1 by demonstrating the power of communication that I had formed when I was young. I participated in the OO Global Challenger by forming a team with my friends in the fields of IT, electrical and electronics, and industrial engineering. However, I had difficulty in deciding on a topic because my interests were different due to different majors. I was able to decide on a topic in the following way. First, I had a meeting with my team members every day. They came to topics that matched everyone's major and discussed which of the various topics was practical and objective. Second, I listened carefully to my opinions. Rather than deciding independently as a leader, I set a common goal by listening to my team members' stories. In this process, I was motivated and could come up with more ideas. Based on this method, I was able to decide on a topic that covers everyone's major. After the topic was decided, several majors could gather and approach it from various perspectives. Based on the synergy effect, I came up with a practical and objective topic, and I was able to pass the document screening process through the competition ratio of 21:1. [Life of communication] I think the definition of communication is 'achievement'. Because of good communication with my team members, I was able to achieve my goal and achieve good results. If I had good results by launching good services, I think I was able to communicate well with customers because I understood their needs well. After joining the company, Dow Technology will show good results not only through customer stories but also through communication with internal employees and related technology companies."" [Dreaming Developer] I made the following efforts to become a program developer. First, I took courses in C, C++, Java, and Android. Through this, I was able to deal with various languages and learn the differences between each language. In addition, the practice was conducted based on the assignment. We produced 'search word ranking program' using C++, 'shopping shopping mall program' using Java, 'mini-game heaven' using Android, and 'Please take care of a working mom'. In addition, 'unmanned parking' project was carried out through the Opencv library and C++ language. I experienced various types of languages based on various practice. Second, I learned the basics and skills of programming through data structure, algorithm, and database subjects. We dealt with algorithms and data structures through algorithm problem sites. Through this, we could learn how to design with an emphasis on optimization and efficiency. Third, we learned about Linux systems through the subjects of system programming, operating system, and embedded computing system. I worked on various projects based on the Linux system. As a graduation work, on the Raspian OS system, we conducted 'Smart Home for Working Mom' using Raspberry Pi and sensors. In addition, in the subject of 'embedded computing system', we conducted a router practice, which is an embedded board. We modified the device driver and controlled the function of the router. [Tennis club participated in many competitions] I worked in tennis club for 3 years as a club member. I learned tennis when I was a freshman, and I became a senior and taught tennis to my juniors. I led my juniors and participated in many tennis competitions. I participated in various competitions such as the National Tennis Club Competition held in Yanggu, Gangwon Province every summer, and the Gyeongin District, where universities from Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, and Incheon participated, so college students from all over the country with the same hobbies gathered and played tennis games to improve their skills. By learning tennis, which is called etiquette sport, I was able to develop respect and consideration for others. I also developed teamwork and communication skills between seniors and juniors."""" As I liked to meet people, I worked part-time at a service job mainly. 1. I worked at a bakery for 3 months. I was responsible for overall business of the store by myself, including customer service, counter work, cleaning the store, and bakery packaging. 2. I worked as an assistant for 13 months at the cram school. Due to the nature of the academy, I was able to meet customers of various ages, mainly targeting parents and students. In addition, I was able to feel the atmosphere of the actual company by using the same office as the employees and those in the general manager's position. As an intern, I worked as an intern at the graduate lab for a year. I mainly worked on the project based on the Linux system. 1. Based on Raspberry Pi and EV3, an automobile robot, the unmanned parking project was carried out by myself. On the Linux-affiliated Raspian operating system, OpenCV and cameras were used to detect the parking line. Through this, we implemented a system that automatically parks by controlling the speed of the wheel motor according to the location of the parking line. 2. As a graduation work, we conducted 'Smart Home for Working Mom' with two people using Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and Android. Based on Raspberry Pi and sensors, we composed gas valves, interphones, air conditioners, refrigerators, fluorescent lamps, and distributor smart home devices. We created the 'Please Take Care of a Working Mom' app and implemented a system that can control smart home devices with a smartphone. Among them, we played the role of developing various smart home devices. In addition, we built a web server to bring smart home devices together, and we were in charge of implementing Android and web servers for post communication.As a result, by implementing a highly completed system, I was among the top five teams out of 70 teams in the free competition for embedded software and won the Presidential Award by ranking first in the competition for excellence and graduation work on campus. The strength of this is responsibility. I have experience that impressed customers through part-time jobs at academies. This experience gave me the opportunity to be recognized by my employees, and I was able to feel a sense of belonging after working continuously for 13 months. Through this, I learned a lesson that if I do my best with responsibility in my duties, I can be recognized by my customers and internal staff. In 2013, I worked part-time as an assistant at an cram school. The assistant's main duties included student management, and the overall supervision of the institute, including House of Representatives, PC management, telephone reception, reading room management, and vending machine management. Among them, when giving guidance to the House of Representatives to ensure that students get on the bus home, the academy bus heading home departed home at the same time every day, and students rarely missed the bus. Then one day, I found a student who missed the bus. The bus had already left and was unable to go home, and the student said he did not know how to get home and had no money to take a taxi. I thought it was my assistant's role to guide the student to arrive home safely, so I decided to take the student home even during rush hour. I contacted the student's mother and asked her home address. I took a taxi with the student and left the house after finishing the House guidance. The next day, the student's mother thanked him and presented him with snacks and letters. This incident allowed me to receive praise and recognition from my staff. Also, whenever I went to the House guidance, I paid more attention to prevent the same thing from happening again. Through this, even after I quit my part-time job because of my studies, they called me whenever I needed a hand so I could constantly be recognized for my ability. Through this, I think that customer emotion is a 'responsibility'. This is because I was able to impress customers when I did what I had to do with responsibility. I will faithfully play my role based on responsibility at Dow Technology, which provides the best service for the impressions of customers. Through this, I will make efforts to expand the market while increasing the satisfaction of related technology companies and customers. The disadvantage [of meticulousness who received scholarships] is that I am meticulous and tend to be a bit late in handling work. I am usually meticulous and can't be satisfied when I work without being perfect. Due to the nature of engineering college, which has many assignments in each subject, when one assignment is completed completely, there were many cases where other assignments were submitted without completing them because the deadline was numbered. To overcome these shortcomings, we prioritize work and prioritize work that can be done quickly. Therefore, I received three scholarships by completing assignments and projects in all subjects. ""After joining the company, I will become a new employee who takes advantage of my strengths, complements my weaknesses, and demonstrates my abilities at Dow Technology."" My motto [8/128's achievements through hard work] is ""Let's make efforts."" If you make efforts, you will get good results in the end. Breaking away from the existing training method and applying a new training method, I became the first among 128 teams to achieve quarterfinals at the 2014 National Tennis Club Championships. When I was a member of a tennis club, I did not do well at the National Tennis Club Championships for several years. Ahead of the competition, club members lost their confidence and tried to put meaning into participation without a goal. As the guidance manager in charge of training, I thought that the reason why I could not perform well was a problem with the training method. I had a meeting with club members every week and set my goal of advancing to the finals, and through feedback, I changed the training method as follows. First, it is 'Experience.' The training method, which was focused on the basic skills, has been changed to focus on the actual games. In the training, each other practiced against each other and conducted the actual game, and after the game was over, they gave advice through feedback. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' In addition to regular lessons, we invited juniors who were not good at it and conducted customized training with them. I transferred their know-how, and I was able to develop my confidence through encouragement. Through this, I became closer between seniors and juniors, and I got the effect of killing two birds with one stone. Lastly, it is 'voluntary.' I trained every day two weeks ago, and changed the training date to three times a week from one month ago. This is because I thought consistency was more important than cramming. In addition, each was encouraged to voluntarily attend three times a week, thereby developing autonomy and responsibility. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I was able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 university teams. Based on these experiences, I learned a lesson that you can achieve good results if you try hard without giving up. In addition, I was able to feel the importance of change without being bound by the existing methods. After joining the company, when there is a situation where the result is bad or difficult to solve, I will not give up and try to find a solution. Rather than doing it alone, I will discuss it with my team members and solve the problem by trying different ways without being afraid of change,"" said Lee. ""I was interested in new IT technologies, so I planned a smart home project. Because I dealt with areas and realities of my interests, I was able to feel interested and develop them, which led to my winning the prize. I think this experience is consistent with the direction of Dow Technology, which communicates with trust and challenges with expertise. After joining the company, Dow Technology will apply new IT technologies and release customer-oriented products that apply trends. I have experience working part-time at an cram school. One of the main tasks when I worked part-time was answering the phone calls from mothers who asked if the students arrived at the institute safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and the biggest concern of working mothers is for working mothers who can keep their child safe at home alone"
"Netmarble, the cornerstone of mobile games, was introduced to countless games when using its first smartphone after being discharged from the military. At the time, mobile games showed two great possibilities. The first is accessibility. Even before smartphones were developed, there were many kinds of mobile games and companies, but accessibility was not good. However, the fact that games can be easily downloaded and played for free with just a few touches has changed to make it easier for users to access them. The second is profitability. By creating a system that allows users to download games for free and pay extra while playing, contents that can help them play were not burdensome for users in the store, and the developer thought that it was a good structure to make a profit. This idea gave me the determination to jump into the game industry after graduation. The times have changed rapidly and the game industry has grown rapidly. As a result, the innovation shown by your company has come in an extraordinary way. I think Netmarble's innovation has led to the base of Korea's current mobile games."""" ""Jukmagou"" ""Stone Age"" with 10 years of experience. ""Stone Age"" is an attractive game that I can't let go of yet, as I came across after watching the movie Jurassic Park when I was in the sixth grade of elementary school. First, the elements that I had fun playing Stone Age for 10 years were the progress of the game on a turn-based basis. The game in which enemies appeared randomly when there was movement in the field and played on a turn-based basis made it easy for adults to play with a simple manipulation method. Second, there is a pet growth rate system. It was fun to raise one pet each because the growth rate was applied differently to each pet, and the range of growth was different depending on the properties of the same petra. Lastly, it is a reincarnation system. If you raised a character to a certain level, you could be reincarnated through a mission, but you could receive a pointer after reincarnation based on the stat distributed to the character before reincarnation or whether the mission was completed. I believe that this reincarnation system provided a foothold for the players to build stronger and stronger characters, and continued to play for a long time. ""Scholarship You're Mine"" After the first semester of my freshman year, I looked at my report card and tuition bill and set my goal for college life as a full scholarship. I can't forget how I felt sorry for my parents at the time. However, in the second semester of my freshman year, I repeated failures and went to the military. After being discharged from the military, I decided to set strategies and change methods. Unlike when I just sat down and memorized things, I did communication and projects through question-and-answer methods and study groups, increasing my participation in class. However, even though I got a score higher than 4.3 in the first and second semesters of my sophomore year and the first semester of my junior year, I didn't receive the full scholarship that only one student received. Still, I worked hard and achieved the goal of full scholarship from the second semester of my junior year to the graduation semester. Like all students, I wasn't very interested in my studies. However, through this work, I realized that effort requires a method, and in the end, persistent effort is the most important.""I think the most important thing in the modern constructivist paradigm is communication. It has become an era in which cooperation between multiple people produces better results than a single genius idea. I have experienced the success of collaborative thinking while working on a team project in college. At that time, the progress of the project was decreasing due to a disagreement between the team leader and the team members. The deadline and progress of each part of the project did not match, and the limit was reached. So, I took on the shortcomings of the team members and tried to complete the project by persuading each team member again to complete the part. Naturally, I took on the role of the team leader, led the overall progress of the project, giving presentations, questions, and answers to the presentation, and bringing out good results and harmony among the team members. ""Challenge through experience"" Everyone sets the direction of life, but they don't always go where they want to go. However, the person who achieves what they have planned is called a successful person. I learned that hard work changes lives even with my life so far. When I first encountered the game on Netmarble and played it until now, I thought that I was working in a related job at any time. I will not be frustrated even if Netmarble does not join the company. As usual, I will think about my shortcomings and what I need to develop and implement them without hesitation. First, I will build a career in a competitive but small-scale mobile company, go overseas and gain 'experience' that I lack the most from various people. Through this experience, I will gain skills and receive offers from your company."","""" Computer Basic and Practice, Logic Circuit, Programming Language and Practice I, Data Structure and Design, Big Data Entrance, Program Language and Practice II, Engineering Design Entrance, Programming Writing Techniques, UNIX Programming, Software Engineering, Application Programming, Information.

In class, I developed a mobile application with my team members. Many students live alone around the school, so they usually order delivery food, but there are not many flyers, so it is difficult to order. Thus, I came up with an application that can provide menus, price information, and phone numbers to restaurants around the school. One of the additional functions along with the market research was the coupon system. Since each restaurant does not have a constant expiration date and longevity, it was developed so that the application can use it in a single coupon to make it easier for students to use it. We designed a circular image so that users can get closer and have a UI in the form of a mind map.When a user presses the desired menu and finds a restaurant that corresponds to the menu, the user's name, address, and phone number are displayed along with the picture of the restaurant. At first, only the team members used it, but gradually began to use it in the department, and the friends complimented me, ""I don't have to go looking for flyers anymore."" Through those words, I still can't forget how I felt when things that had been struggling at the time were unraveling. ,,,,"
"""Creating something out of nothing."" Since I was a child, I have been praised for having unique ideas by surprising people around me by drawing pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others have never imagined. I became interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas and naturally went on to major in computer science. In order to develop a new concept of service that others could not come up with, I tried to build up my competence as a developer by completing a number of programming expert courses at Academy O, an educational institution for development experts as well as majoring in universities. As the first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called OO a year ago. It was intended to provide customers' trust and convenience through an operation method called ""pre-check-and-pay"" that differentiates it from the existing shopping mall called ""pre-check-and-check."" In addition, through the concept of providing personalized styling services, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls, and targeted niche markets by making men rather than women the main customers. Naturally, this became the first opportunity in the shopping mall industry to realize individual male O2O styling services, and returns and refunds were 4% lower on average than competitors. Based on these results, I was able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing startup of OOO. However, despite these achievements, I encountered unexpected difficulties while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem alone. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code sample and manual provided by the payment PG company were very different from the server platform Node.js, which is the server platform I implemented, so it was difficult to implement. I tried to find PHP programming books and internet search, but I wasted five days. Eventually, I asked the payment PG company for help through phone call and e-mail, and I felt a great sense of despondency when I learned that it was a problem that could be solved easily in just a day. With this as an opportunity, I am trying to solve the problem quickly by asking and learning who the target person is. Although there were many difficulties while developing the service due to its shortcomings, the responsibility of being the ""owner of the service"" was the driving force behind the commercialization of the shopping mall service. It was not an easy task to develop the front/back-end of the service by myself because I was the only developer in a startup team composed of various majors. However, this startup was started with my idea, and I was able to implement and commercialize the service within the target period after staying up all night at the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of development. Through the start-up of the fashion shopping mall, I practiced ""passion"" and ""challenge"" by creating the first men's personal styling service that could not be found in existing shopping malls, and I was able to cultivate ""professionalism"" to run out of school to develop solid services and gain professional competence by directly entering educational institutions for development professionals. [The determination to walk 800 kilometers in person for 24 days] My hobby is trekking. A year ago, I had the experience of completing the 800-km pilgrimage route in Spain by walking my own feet. I was challenged to overcome my weak willpower that could not end anything. Since I had to walk 800 kilometers in person for about a month, I have improved my physical strength through constant exercise since six months before the challenge. In addition, I prepared in advance so that there would be no difficulty in the journey by studying the route of the pilgrim, the culture, and the language of Spain. Contrary to the expectations that the first day of the journey would be enjoyable, the process of crossing the Pyrenees, located on the border between Spain and France, was very difficult and made me even want to give up. When I found my first accommodation across the Pyrenees, I felt proud and delighted that I had completed anything, which was easily giving up on anything. I wasted my day on the wrong route during the journey, got picked up by a pickpocket at a village festival, had problems with my travel budget, and I often wanted to give up due to numerous difficulties, such as walking 30 km with a heavy body wearing a raincoat on a rainy day. However, whenever I encountered these difficulties, I focused and focused only on walking with the will to finish it somehow. After 24 days of walking without giving up, we arrived at our destination, Santiago, and my heart was filled with memories of overcoming difficulties on our last journey. Through the path of pilgrims, I was able to discover myself the determination to finish everything off without giving up."" ""Two years ago to gain practical development skills in addition to lectures at the school, I completed various programming professional courses at the O Academy, an educational institution for development professionals. In about six months of training at the O Academy, I took professional courses in Android, mobile servers, and databases. And I experienced two mobile app development projects that I aimed to commercialize using them. The subject I found most interesting at the O Academy was Android. Java was the most proficient language of my undergraduate years, and Android, a platform based on Java, naturally felt comfortable to me. The free expression of the GUI through Android programming even made me feel like an artist who paints on a blank sheet of paper. I was also delighted that I had developed a client that could communicate with the server for the first time by implementing a Network Manager module that Post/Get with the server. While developing the Network Manager module, the process of parsing information transmitted to the Json data structure of the server's Restful API service gave the impression that it was decoding a secret. Based on this Android programming, a project team was formed to develop a crowdfunding platform service for abandoned dogs.It wasn't easy to get out of the position of being taught by someone and into a position of having to do it yourself. Especially for me, who is new to designing the architecture of Android systems, it felt difficult and complicated to draw the big picture of the service. As I worked on UX/UI with the designer and collaborated with the server developer to realize it after all, I was able to gain confidence in my career as a developer as I saw myself completing each function. In addition, through this project, I was able to gain a sense of responsibility to act as an expert in my role in a team of people in various fields, professionalism, and communication skills to coordinate opinions through smooth communication when I had conflicts with team members.""""

"SK Encar has the industry's best used car quality guarantee service called Encar Warranty, and a ""Hutstep Compensation System"" for victims who purchase bait products or false items, confirming that SK Encar puts customer trust first. In addition, statistics that about 1 million cars are registered annually and the number of online and mobile visitors exceeds 400,000 every day show that customers already trust SK Encar. [Challenging to start a business based on customer trust] I think I look a lot like SK Encar in that I value customer trust as my top priority. When I was an undergraduate, I had the experience of conceiving and starting a shopping mall where customers could buy clothes with confidence. Unlike conventional shopping malls, which check products offline after paying online in advance, we came up with a customer-reliable shopping mall operation method in which clothes are delivered offline first and then paid online on the spot. In addition, by allocating one stylist per customer, we made it possible to solve customers' concerns about styling through a messenger in the app. After the commercialization of the service, I was able to get a lot of advice on styling from customers who actually used the service, and I heard that I could trust it because I could try it on and pay first. As a result of practicing this customer trust first, only 4% of all payments were returned or refunded. We have applied to SK Encar to show the customer trust-based service development capabilities experienced through the start-up of a clothing shopping mall at SK Encar, which puts customer trust first. I think SK Encar service, which customers can trust and use, is possible only when it is based on solid software technology. To this end, in the short and long term, I promise to become an employee as follows. [In line with the big data era], I will try to become an expert in the big data field, which has recently become important. We will acquire various big data technologies such as automobile and used car market analysis, machine learning, deep learning, Spark, and Hadoop, which are big data analysis algorithm technologies to identify and convey consumer trends, and apply them to SK Encar's web and mobile application services. SK Encar's service applied with big data technology will contribute to innovating consumers' automobile life. [Trying to develop various services] SK Encar will constantly challenge to develop innovative and diverse services to get closer to consumers' car life. We will systemize the essential elements of car life, such as installment financing, car washing, maintenance, and vehicle renovation, as well as vehicle purchase and sales services. To this end, we will actively embrace new IT technologies and actively practice leading service development. Through this, we will try to become SK Encar that provides higher quality and convenience to our customers. [Preparation for Global Market] Based on know-how accumulated through experience in the online/offline car sales business in Korea, SK Encar will become an employee who will lead the global expansion to realize customer impressions beyond the trust of customers around the world. To this end, we will continue to improve our foreign language skills so that SK Encar can expand overseas at any time."" [Teamwork learned through club activities] During the winter vacation of my third year at university, I studied Android programming with the desire to commercialize the program I developed myself. I joined the EP Development Association Club OO because I thought it would be fun to develop it with many people rather than alone. OO was an external club composed of not only computer engineering students but also various university students such as business, philosophy, English literature, and design. These members were classified into planners, designers, and developers, and they formed a team and selected a topic to develop an app. In the meeting on what kind of app to make in the first team, we each expressed our opinions on the app we wanted to create. I always wanted an app that comprehensively stores and manages favorite URL strings set through Internet browser apps such as Google and Naver. Accordingly, I presented this to my team members and started to create an app with the function with the consent of the team members. At the beginning of the project, when designing functions and screens with my team members, they drew pictures on a blank sheet of paper, and each came up with a lot of strange but popping ideas. Seeing that designers or planners put out screen compositions or functions that I couldn't come up with, rather than developers, I realized why a team project should consist of people from various fields. It was a situation where the design of both the function and the UX was completed and the app was only developed. However, it was more difficult to implement the function than I thought, and in the end, the app could not be developed within the period. Due to the great feeling of self-blame and responsibility that I did not fulfill my role, I entered T Academy, a development expert education institution, and completed the Android and mobile server expert course for 6 months in order not to repeat these mistakes. I led the study by serving as the study group leader to share the middle and high-end Android technologies I learned at T Academy with the club developer team members. Through this, the development capabilities of all club developers were improved, and most of the teams were able to implement the applications envisioned in the team project that was conducted later. I have a lot of experience not only in internal activities of the club but also in external activities. I have participated in competitions or idea competitions several times with my club members. The 2014 Samsung Gear 2 hackathon competition is the most memorable of them. This competition was to develop Tizen OS-based applications that run on Samsung Electronics' Gear 2 products for 1 night and 2 days. A week before participating in the competition, we are fully prepared, including selecting the topic of the application, selecting the members, and dividing the roles. The theme is to develop a navigation application on the wrist for the visually impaired.In order to fulfill my role in development at the time, I applied for a Tizen programming book as a desired book at the school library and prepared for the competition by self-taught. On the day of the competition, we developed applications in a way that matched our roles. Although the competition was given a tight deadline to sleep one night and two days, we were able to complete the application development by the time the next morning's sunrise by relying on each of our team members. Perhaps because of my efforts, I won the OO Award for highly social contribution application among the outstanding teams of competitors. I still remember the impression that 'all of this was possible because of the cohesiveness of the team members.' Through the OO club, I was able to learn the sense of cooperation that unites toward the same goal as team members and the sense of responsibility that each member must work on the project with a sense of ownership in order to implement it were also good experiences. ""I was praised for having unique ideas since I was young. I became interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas, and naturally, I majored in computer engineering during college. As the first step to surprise the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO'. In order to differentiate myself from the existing shopping mall operation method of pre-payment and confirmation, I came up with a rather unconventional operation method of payment after pre-payment. In addition, in line with the recent trend of increasing interest of male office workers in styling, we came up with a personal styling service with male office workers as our main customers. After the commercialization of the service, it gained the reputation of being the first O2O service in the shopping mall market and was selected as a nurturing start-up company of OO. Through my startup activities, I gained confidence that my unique idea can inspire people greatly. However, there were also difficulties in these achievements. Due to my shortcomings that I did not rely well on others, I encountered unexpected difficulties in the middle of service development. Once the payment system was implemented, the service could be commercialized. I had no experience in implementing the payment system, so I tried to implement it by looking at the code samples and manuals of the payment PG. While the code samples and manuals provided by PG were PHP-based, the server platform I developed was unable to obtain relevant information because it was Javascript-based Node.js. I wasted 5 days trying to solve this problem alone, but I couldn't. Eventually, I asked PG for help through phone or e-mail, visited the practitioner in person, and learned it, and I learned that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a single day. If there is something I don't know to compensate for the shortcomings of not relying on others for my ignorance, whether the target is a senior or a junior, I am trying to build up my quick competencies by approaching first, asking and learning. I think OO was possible because of my advantage of 'keeping the principles even if it is urgent'. In development, I did not overlook the important design and the principle of documentation based on it. From the beginning of the design, we designed and analyzed the functions necessary for the service with the planner to document the Restful API and DB table structure. I thought this was an essential principle for the expansion and efficient management of the system structure in the future. I conceived UX/UI together with the designer and made the design guide line for the efficiency of UX layout development. By documenting the initial functional design, unnecessary function implementation was prevented in advance and time was not wasted. In addition, we were able to reduce the designer's effort by developing it by referring to the relevant document without asking the designer one by one during UX implementation with the design guide line document. Thanks to this, we were able to complete and commercialize the service about a month earlier than the initial planned development period. In addition, I think the responsibility of being the owner of the service was the driving force behind OO. I was the only developer in the college student start-up team consisting of various majors such as management, design, and fashion. Obviously, developing the service's Front/Back-End system by myself was not easy. However, I developed the service all-night for three months in the office with the responsibility that no one else could take charge of the development because it was started with my idea. Because of my principles and responsibility, I was able to realize my idea, OO, and I was able to have a valuable experience of starting a business."",,"
"I applied to IT OO Academy to learn programming and work in the IT industry, which I was usually interested in. When I was young, there was a token on the city bus, and when I took the subway, I used paper tickets. But now, it is a world where people pay directly with their cell phones. IT technology has completely changed how we live our lives over the past 20 years, and I have been very interested in new technologies since I was a child, and I would like to know how IT can change our lives in the future. I took various classes while attending the Department of Statistics, but what I was most interested in was the Statistical Programming class. It was really interesting to write R or SQL codes and derive results. I also studied statistical programming when I had a conference in a big data club. I used R and PYTHON to do internal tasks. I was interested in coding, so I personally studied C and PYTHON. ""I attended the Department of Statistics and took a Statistical Programming class. I learned R and SAS through computer data processing classes, and I learned MSSQL by taking data analysis and design classes. I also took many classes using a programming language in other statistics classes. In the second half of 2014, I worked as an intern at OO for half a year. I learned two survey coding languages based on java script and immediately used them in the field. After finishing the internship, I joined a big data club and worked for 10 months. I studied R in the club and also learned PYTHON for data processing, so I learned website crawling, natural language processing, and data handling using packages. While working as an OO intern in the second half of 2016, I performed the task of extracting and analyzing data from the server through SAS."", ""If I join LG CNS, I will first do my best to increase my programming skills for work. I will continue to study my background knowledge about the fields I will work with and combine them with my programming skills so that I can get better results. Not only will I do it right away, but I will be an employee who can learn ahead of time and help others without hesitation in accepting new things. Through my mindset that likes new things, I will try to become a talented person who can adapt no matter what job I take. In 10 years, my goal is to be in a leading position in the project based on my experience, ability, and communication ability to generate synergy, and my long-term goal is to become an expert that people can think of first in my field."",,,,"
"I have the experience of developing a fashion shopping mall based on the O2O structure a year ago. I applied because I thought that my development capabilities best fit SK Planet's O2O Platform development. As an engineer of SK Planet, I want to become an expert in O2O Marketing Platform architecture. We will open a new chapter in the consumption culture by providing optimized shopping information and convenient shopping experiences for individual customers, going back and forth between mobile and offline. In order to become an expert in O2O Marketing Platform architecture, I have built up my experience and competence in the development job with the mind of constantly challenging myself as follows. First, through the start-up experience, I realized the customer-oriented Platform service by understanding it from the customer's point of view through the start-up of a fashion shopping mall called OO, which practices customer-oriented business, and melting the customer's needs into the service. In addition, by developing an O2O Platform-type commerce service, I was able to understand and personally experience SK Planet's Platform Business philosophy. Second, improvement of development capabilities through T-Academy. In order to gain professional development capabilities, T-Academy, an educational institution for development experts operated by SK Planet, showed passion for completing two courses of experts in Android and mobile servers in succession. In addition to development capabilities, T-Academy has gained teamwork skills to solve problems with people in various fields, as well as understanding and communicating skills and communication skills through team projects. Third, after learning practical skills through internship at a solution company for 9 months, I experienced practical organizational culture and developed technical skills, responsibility, and perseverance that practical developers should possess. Through these capabilities, I will contribute to SK Planet becoming a global Platform Business company leading the global market.""[Self-Honoring] I have experience working as an intern at a company whose main business is producing LTE modem chips and developing solutions until recently. During my internship period, I had the opportunity to participate in a firmware development project for smart meters that send and receive data that measured the power consumption of each home to and from electricity companies. My role was to implement a socket server that received data on the amount of power measured by clients through socket communication. I was nervous because it was a relatively big task, but I decided with the responsibility of implementing it perfectly because the team members trusted me and entrusted it. Not long after I started developing the function I was in charge of, I encountered difficulties. When the socket server was initially implemented, the server handled the process of accepting the client's socket connection request in a blocking manner, and if two or more clients send packets at the same time, the server could not receive them in order, resulting in a file descriptor error. I tried to solve this problem alone, such as socket programming books and internet search, but I couldn't solve it and wasted three days. After suffering alone, I decided that it would have a big impact on the project deadline, so I ended up explaining the cause of the problem and what needs to be resolved to the senior developer within the team and asking for advice. I was advised by the senior developer that changing the part that was treated as a blocking structure to a non-blocking structure would solve the problem, and the code was modified with that structure. Since then, not only two but also 10 clients sent packets at the same time, no problem has occurred. Realizing that it was a problem that could be solved easily in just one day, I scolded myself for almost having a setback in the project's progress due to my pride in trying to solve it alone. With this opportunity, I try to solve a problem by myself for a day when it arises, and if it is judged that more time is required, I try to solve the problem quickly by asking and learning who the target audience is."""" In my third year of university, I joined the EP Development Association club 'OO' because I thought it would be fun to develop it with many people rather than alone. I felt a strong sense of belonging as I experienced many external activities such as contests and contests as well as active internal activities such as study and project at OO. The most memorable event during my activities was the OO Hackathon that I participated in 2014. The competition was to develop Tizen OS-based applications that run on OO products for one night and two days. A week before participating in the competition, we were fully prepared with the members of the club, including selecting an application topic, selecting members, and sharing roles. As the theme, we decided to develop a navigation app on the wrist for the visually impaired. My role at the time was to develop a function that sounds vibrations and notifications when the navigation map deviates from the path. In order to perform my role, I applied for a Tizen programming book at the school library as a desired book and prepared for the competition by self-study to myself. On the day of the competition, we developed applications according to our respective roles. Although the competition was given a tight deadline to sleep, one night and two days, we were able to complete the application development by the time the next morning's sun came out, relying on each other. Among the prominent working-level competitor teams, I won a special award for being an application with a high social contribution. As I was speaking at the acceptance speech, I still vividly remember the sentence, 'All of this was possible because of the cohesion of the team members'. Through the club OO, it was a good experience to learn the sense of cooperation that unites toward the same goals as team members and the responsibility that each member should work on the project with a sense of ownership."",""[The first men's personal styling service in a shopping mall, OO] A year ago, I challenged myself to start a fashion shopping mall named 'OO' with my colleagues who worked on a project together at OO. We tried to provide customers' trust and convenience through the operation method called 'Preliminary Payment' which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'Preliminary Payment'. In addition, we tried to make it competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services and targeted niche markets by making men rather than women their main customers. Naturally, this became the first opportunity for the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling services for men, and returns and refunds were 4% lower on average than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing startup of SK Planet.

As such, big data technology will gradually change society as a new way of making decisions. SK C&C has ICT capabilities for data collection and analysis, and is active in various fields of society based on big data solutions. I think big data technology will be the main food that will lead SK C&C's growth now and in the future. I learned about big data in the Department of Statistics, and I wanted to work in a big data club and handle data.

""I have been a scholarship student at the school library for a total of one year since I was a freshman at the university. My job was to scan and edit old books. However, when I tried to use the scanner, it stopped roaring and I had to repeat the same task to scan one page. Nevertheless, because the scanners were expensive, I didn't dare to fix them, and everyone was scanning so slowly. Increasingly conscious of the problem with the slow speed of work, I started to find a solution. I observed the movement of the scanner when I pressed the scan button, and I studied why it wasn't working. After observing the scanner, I found that the machine lacked the power to move, and I found that if I pushed it by hand before it stopped, it would scan normally. Although there was an inconvenience of having to keep pushing the machine while standing up, I was able to process one copy per hour, which was done every few minutes, and I was able to hear compliments from my staff. After going through this, I thought that in order to innovate, it was necessary to constantly pay attention to and observe the field."""" As a freshman, I joined an on-campus classical music appreciation club and have been active until now. After working in the club for six years, I spent much of my college life hosting various club events such as the club's 40th anniversary events. As I spent a long time, there were many conflicts among club members. As one of the conflicts, there was a junior who particularly hated the chairman. I was dissatisfied with everything that had been set and walked away, and both the chairman and the club members were stressed out about it. I was close to my junior unlike everyone else, so I was asked what happened, and I was told that I felt betrayed by the chairman, who was close to my junior, who was asked to leave the club due to past incidents. I came to persuade my junior members by standing in the position of defending him so that he could get along well in the club, and whenever he said bad things to the chairman, I was able to resolve the conflict within the club by telling him."","""" In July 2014, I applied for an internship for the operation of the Youth Panel Survey and the Aging Research Panel, which was conducted from OO under the commission of OO, and worked for six months. As a statistics student, I was interested in surveys that collected statistics and wanted to learn about my future company life in advance. My job was to produce surveys and manage personal information of researchers and panels. However, I was not used to coding a programming language for surveys that I had never seen before, and I had a hard time with the volume of surveys being very large. As I wanted to complete my work successfully, I searched for applications and Internet documents and studied them. As the deadline approached, I worked overtime until midnight, and I finally completed the survey within the deadline and was able to complete it in December without any problems. After the project, I had dinner with various departments and felt proud that I had successfully completed the project.

During the internship period, I learned a new language by learning survey programming tools called Blaise and Confirm. In addition, I was able to experience company life and project execution by constantly communicating with other departments for the project. In the big data club that I joined after the internship, I learned R and Python programming for big data analysis. In addition, I was able to experience data analysis in real life through projects within the society. Since we were not participating in an external contest, we all had time to program after discussing the direction of the analysis with significance. The first project I did was predicting moviegoers. The box office api data provided by the Korea Film Council was downloaded and processed so that it could be analyzed through R or Python, and the number of spectators for three days was predicted by considering similar movies and the number of spectators by day of the week. The next project was a project to crawl posts on Naver's cafe bulletin board using Python. Our group crawled through posts from meetings of people who sent their boyfriends to the military, and analyzed which groups of couples did not break up until they were discharged. In addition, to find out the characteristics of separated couples, we analyzed the posts of separated parties and visualized the mainly used words. I want to be in charge of big data at SK C&C. In particular, I want to do something that is helpful to society by using public data.

"Making something for people. When I first learned about computers, I became interested in the relationship between S/W and the people who use them. Naturally, the interest developed into the idea of creating a web/mobile that makes people convenient. So, I planned and developed an app that helps me group up with friends and manage my schedule together based on the web and mobile. OONote was the beginning of my first project to create something for people. Starting with this, I carried out projects that were close to people, such as an intranet that easily stores and manages members' information, promotional sites that use dynamic effects to entertain users' eyes, and websites that support home sharing procedures. And now I am working on a number of projects that make people convenient, and I think about how to serve them beyond just simply serving them. I have been developing them so far, wondering whether users can get what they want with efficient movement and how to construct algorithms for pleasant performance. I took pride in making something for people and worked hard to make a better program, so I was able to grow to this day. I think this tendency coincides with Naver's direction of providing user-centered services. Now I want to continue my pride in Naver. [Javascript 4] It is not too difficult to implement the function.

So, we separated the responsibilities of classes by designing the business logic of home sharing as an interface with the Controller-Service-Store. In addition, DI using annotation was also actively used. As expected, the requirements between projects changed from moment to moment, and we were able to successfully carry out the project safely because we designed it for this. [NOSQL Web Dashboard - Javascript] Using NOSQL's Rest api, we implemented a web dashboard that fetches and visualizes the status values of DB. The goal is to implement a gauge bar that represents Ram's space, a chart that shows traffic in the past, and a component that can see live nodes at a glance. Although we received the existing JS source, it was minified and it seemed difficult for humans to analyze. So, rather than analyzing it with limited resources, we developed it in a way that we re-implemented it using an open source library related to visualization. Using a library, but parts that did not meet the requirements were modified after analyzing the library, so we created components of the dashboard one by one, and we were able to complete the project within the promised deadline.

"[There is no tree that cannot climb!] When faced with a really difficult task, I confronted them with the idea that there is no tree that cannot climb. It was time to work on a design project for a coffee vending machine in the logic circuit subject. We went beyond meeting the requirements and proceeded with this project with the goal of designing a vending machine like a commercial vending machine. At first, I looked at the internet and drawings to find out the algorithms and principles of how they operate. I applied that principle to design and program a gate circuit, but I was unable to proceed with this project due to an unknown error. So, leaving the project aside, after referring to related books and studying other instructions, I reviewed the design process and found that there was an error in adjusting the time of the input waveform on the test bench and corrected it. The idea of making a vending machine that can be put out on the market was an opportunity for me to try to develop more program skills that I lacked the idea of making a vending machine that could be put out on the market, and I was able to complete this project successfully.

[Always ready to help!] When someone else is in trouble within the IDIS team after joining the company, I am confident that I will always lead them by giving them help. It was time to take a test in dance sports, a liberal arts course. The paired Spanish Emma and Elena did not speak Korean, so they fell behind in class, so the professor looked for someone to help them. At that time, I offered to help. The two-member dance was organized through a situational play of a man who was conflicted between the two women, using a different situation than the three of them. I taught them the dance and steps I learned using all the methods I could, and I stayed in the practice room and practiced supplementary to get together with the two. And after the practice was over, we completed our teamwork by eating together. In the end, I got a perfect score in originality and compositional score on the last test. Through this experience, I had a chance to think more about the definition of helping others. However, if you help others with the full time and effort that you can spend, sometimes you can't concentrate and use all of them. I think this is because I didn't know how good I was at covering it and helped them first. In order to fix this, I try to reflect on myself and try to help before I can help. As I realize that there are many cases where it helps me in the end, I try to be more helpful in the way that I can. After joining IDIS, helping a team member in need is ultimately for the whole team, and furthermore, for the whole team, if there is a team member in need, I will step up and lead with the help."","""" Communicative Developer!"" My S/W Development and Big Data Technology are my strengths in performing the S/W development task of IDAS. To make up for the practical process of big data competency that my major knowledge is lacking, I took the Big Data Manager Course from the oo Association. I learned JAVA, Oracle, Hadoop, and R through the training. And based on this, I worked on four team projects with people from other majors, such as humanities, statistics, and others, rather than just a team between majors. As a result, I was able to work on projects such as Indigame Development, Police Station Management System, School Web Application, and Employment Personnel Management System. This gave me an opportunity to upgrade my S/W development capabilities. In addition, I participated in the 'DA Design Contest' and modeled the data on the human resources management system of a company. While conducting data modeling that meets the company's requirements, I was able to have practical experience of B2B, which is different from B2C. Through this S/W development experience and various experiences of B2B and B2C, I was interested in and applied for IDIS's S/W development job."" When choosing a company, I choose based on the following criteria. Is it a company that I can learn from? I want to join a company that makes me more curious about myself 5 or 10 years after I joined the company. It was when I was in the first grade when I was in the programming club. I developed my programming skills through information exchange with seniors who used basic education and public lecture time. At the end of the semester, I learned programming skills and achieved good grades in programming-related subjects. While working as a club, I experienced myself growing up along with my programming skills. Also, I thought it would be the icing on the cake if I could work in an active attitude with interest. By contributing to IDIS by developing through learning, I would like to promote growth together and become a member of IDIS that I am curious to see in 5 years and 10 years from now. I will tackle the task with passion and finish it with my own hands. I remember the moments when I participated in the Campus Patent Strategy Universiade and tried to overcome and challenge myself passionately for 3 months. In order to solve the problem, based on the understanding of technology, patents, and intellectual property rights, the technology and patents were analyzed and the possibility of infringement, invalidation, and avoidance design were presented through the analysis. First, the main components of the patent were analyzed to understand the patent in question and the technology in question. However, there was a limit to understanding the technology at the company level. So I searched for basic books related to technology and studied them deeply, and tried to understand the technology by reading explanations on the background technology in hundreds of papers. Then, I found related patents and papers based on the technology analysis. Of the thousands of patents obtained by searching the key components of the patent with keywords, we found a total of five key prior art documents related to this patent.Since the patent in question was a U.S. patent, as a result of persistent review of the data sheets of the products related to this patent by the leading communication equipment companies in the U.S., we found that this patent could be invalidated by oo's products. In addition, judging that there is a possibility of invalidation of this patent through prior art literature, a solution called avoidance design was proposed to compose the design by changing the core parts that may infringe on this patent in a different way. Through the analysis, we found a product related to the possibility of invalidation of this patent and also found the possibility of patent infringement by other prior literature. There were many difficulties in the process of solving the problem, but we analyzed the problem with the idea of 'be an expert in this patent more than anyone else'. As a result, we were able to get good results. I will take the responsibility and passion for the work gained through this experience to work in the S/W development department of IDIS."", ""���, I will take on the task of the S/W development department of IDIS."""
"[Leap of Signage Business] When I was in college, I developed interest in the signage business by working on my graduation work 'Project to Improve Subway Kiosk'. In order to increase the interest in using the kiosk that was inadvertently left unattended in the subway, we announced a plan to activate the kiosk by combining Kinect's motion recognition technology. We controlled the kiosk through hand gesture recognition and promoted the recommendation menu by category to promote the local community, increasing the interest of users. Although we did not win the prize at the graduation exhibition, we were evaluated as a positive system that will activate the kiosk of the subway. The interest in the signage business was raised by cultivating and cultivating basic knowledge about Java, JSP, HTml, and DB during the JAVA curriculum, which completed in August, we prepared for the future by honing our development skills to create a link between the web and objects. In May, Samsung Electronics announced a signage system that usually uses it as a general mirror through its 'mirror display' and provides various information on beauty and hair care if necessary. It led communication with users, not simply delivering information. I believe that the signage market is such a growing field that all existing walls of the world are called potential markets. I will become a member of Samsung SDS and lead the company into B2B's representative business by developing not only displays but also system solutions that control them.""[Life of OOOs like a bamboo] When I was in fourth grade, OOO first encountered the science box and connected parts directly to broaden our understanding of the principle of power and operation of machines. When I was in sixth grade, I participated in the Incheon Science Box Assembly as an autonomous theme, and completed the space station I imagined and received the bronze medal within the limited time. Although I was young, I applied the principle of power using provided parts and motors based on creative ideas, and I was able to achieve good results by demonstrating my dexterity and concentration. The sense of accomplishment that I felt at that time gave me a good opportunity to decide to major in the future in engineering. After entering college, I learned the importance of ideas to change our lives conveniently and effectively in the creative engineering design class. I had a class that presented ways to improve uncomfortable systems in school in IT. Through brainstorming, we came up with various ideas, and among them, we decided to improve the problems of the school's academic system. Because there was only one academic discipline on campus, students were always crowded and there was a long line outside the restaurant to buy meal tickets. In order to solve the problem of the delay in mealtime, we proposed a change to a system that allows students to pay directly with a card as a vehicle passes through the toll booth in a high-pass manner, and we calculated the expected system structure, development period, and development cost and presented it in the class. The professor praised it as a good system to improve the problems of learning. Currently, the school's academic discipline has been changed to a system that allows payment by card like high-pass, providing convenience in school life. Bamboo will not sprout in the first year if it is buried in the ground and fertilized, and then it will finally sprout in the fifth year and grow by 20m in about 90 days. The engineering interest I have developed since childhood has been filled with knowledge through IT-related activities through computer engineering major selection, and in the fourth year, I have demonstrated my skills through the subway kiosk project using my graduation work Kinect.

""[Pocketball Go's potential for augmented reality development] Recently, the most popular game in the global game community is Niantic's Pok辿mon GO. It is an augmented reality smartphone game created using location-based services that swept through the App Store and Google Play Store in 24 hours when it was released in North America on July 6. People flocked to New York's Central Park to catch rare Pok辿mon, and the fact that it will become a Pok辿mon GO in only some areas such as Sokcho in Korea sparked the Sokcho tourism craze. I, too, headed to Sokcho to catch Pok辿mon and enjoyed the game passionately, collecting a total of 43 kinds of 160 monsters for two days and one night. Many companies rushed into the augmented reality market to the extent that it was said that they needed to develop a Korean version of Pok辿mon GO, but about two months later, as the popularity of Pok辿mon GO cooled, the number of users and sales dropped sharply compared to the installation of the app, and problems were raised. First of all, it was difficult to communicate smoothly with users due to the problem of bugs due to the system that has not yet been stabilized compared to the high interest, and we were busy reflecting on successful cases that we did not have before without properly analyzing the cause. With augmented reality technology in full swing, I think the biggest challenge for us is how to lead the long-term driving force rather than ending the initial market frenzy in a single shot. In addition, it will be important to pay attention to new technologies that have great potential for future development first and take an active attitude to lead the market change. Samsung SDS introduced Cello VWS, a warehouse management system using virtual reality, in March, and supplemented the limitations of the logistics site through remote monitoring using VR outside the warehouse. In the future, augmented reality will complement the problems of the real world and provide convenience to users, and will be useful in the home, medical, and defense industries. We need to break away from the passive attitude of our society and actively take the lead in the future market."",,,,"
"[Columbus Ho, Coupang of E-commerce] Coupang has shown the world a variety of innovative services that are not a waste of the name 'Korea's E-commerce leader'. By running Coupang Man, its own delivery manpower, and realizing 'rocket delivery' aimed at same-day delivery rather than just delivery, we have established a 'direct commerce model' that provides direct services from product sales to delivery for the first time in the world. In addition, for the first time in the industry, we have built and operated a 'safe number service' that protects personal information through virtual phone numbers instead of customers' actual phone numbers. Through this, the statistics show that 50% of the people use the Coupang app and the number of mobile app users in the same industry for four consecutive years, confirming that Coupang has become the number one mobile app users for users. I think I look a lot like Coupang in that I lead innovation through 'first'. A year ago, I had the experience of starting a fashion shopping mall with a rather unconventional operation method called 'pre-check-and-check payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall's 'pre-payment and confirmation' operation method. By improving the cumbersome refund and return process of consumers through the 'pre-check and payment' operation method, we tried to provide customers with trust and convenience. In addition, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services, and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women as our main customer base. This naturally led to the realization of the 'first male-customized O2O styling service' in the shopping mall industry, and returns and refunds were made at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. This experience in starting a business made me dream as a system architecture expert in the e-commerce field, realizing unique ideas into innovative services. In order to realize my dream, I applied to Coupang, which is best realizing innovative services through 'first'. I will become a sailor of the Columbus ferry Coupang, and I will discover and pioneer a new continent in the field of e-commerce that has not yet been discovered."" [Develop is My Life] Since childhood, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others could not have imagined. People around me were surprised by my paintings and praised me for having unique ideas. I became interested in programming that allowed me to express my unique ideas freely like on a canvas, and naturally moved on to the Department of Computer Science. I continued my interest in programming not only through my major learning but also through the activities of the app development club. When I was a senior in college, I became greedy to develop a service through programming and set a goal of surprising the world by realizing my unique idea into a real service. In order to develop a real service, I felt that my major knowledge alone was not enough, so I stepped out of the well of the school and entered T Academy, an educational institution for development experts. By completing two courses by experts in Android and mobile servers at T Academy, I have built enough service development capabilities to implement the service in real life. With these development capabilities and my own unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago as the first step to surprise the world. I led the team by directly leading the team toward the goal of creating the 'first men's personal styling service' by bringing together college students from various majors such as business, fashion, and design. As a service developer, I had a lot of conversations with planners about service function processes and with designers about service UX/UI to understand the broad range of services and improve the composition of service screens efficiently. In addition, I tried to communicate a lot with stylists who face customers directly through styling, and through this, I tried to improve the service quality by identifying processes that are not actually needed and processes that need to be added in the service. Based on these efforts, I was honored to be selected as SK Planet's nurturing start-up, but due to various business deteriorations, I finally decided to close the business. Although it was the first failure in society, the two things I could get from starting a business are the passion to become an expert and build development capabilities, and the ability to communicate with team members regardless of job to create better services. The reason I want to become an S/W developer is that I feel that the moment of development is the most valuable moment for me. In addition, the process of uniting for one goal with diverse people felt the most enjoyable to me. The easiest and best way to express my unique ideas, which is quirky but unique, is programming, and I will continue to build up my competence as a developer without stopping to value myself."",""1) Smart Meter Project / OOO / 2016.05 ~ 2016.06 - Project Introduction: It is a project to develop a Firmware Solution for smart meters that collects electricity usage data from each home and sends it to electric companies by loading it on LTE signals. - Development Environment: [Linux / Ubuntu 14.01], [C, Shell / Eclipse CDT], [SVN / GCT SVN Source Storage] - In charge Development: Implementation of Multi Client Socket Server ��� We developed a socket server that receives the power data measured by the application through socket communication with the Multi Client Socket Server client. It was developed with a Multi Client Connection structure because it has a structure where multiple clients send packets at the same time. It was also implemented in a TCP socket structure for packet transmission reliability. While implementing the function, if more than one client transmits packets at the same time, a file descriptor error occurred that the server could not receive in order.As a result of analyzing the problem, it was because the server handled the process of accepting the client's socket connection request in a blocking manner. At the same time, the problem could be solved by modifying the blocking structure to a non-blocking structure so that the server can receive packets sent by multiple clients asynchronously. Through this project, we were able to accurately understand the principle and structure of socket communication and the difference between synchronous/asynchronous communication. 2) Smartfren MIFI Andromax M2Y Firmware Development / OOO / 2016.01~2016.04 - Project Introduction: It is a project to develop Firmware of 'Andromax M2Y', a pocket WiFi of Smartfren, one of the Indonesian telecommunications companies. The device is a portable router that enables data to be used using 4G LTE signals using Pocket WiFi. - Development Environment: [Linux/Ubuntu 14.01], [C, Shell, javascript/Eclipse CDT], [SVN/GCT SVN Source Storage] - Responsible Development: Marvell WiFi Application Control Daemon Development, Network Advanced Settings Function Implementation, WiFi Disk Implementation ��� Marvell WiFi Application Control Daemon Development CPE Web Page that allows users to change WiFi setting information through Host IP. The client was configured using HTML, JavaScript, and Jquery, and the web interface was implemented with Cgi. We developed the Linux Daemon program to control WiFi applications and set WiFi configuration information through this Web Page. ��� Network Advanced Settings Implementation A number of filtering functions have been implemented for indiscriminate intrusion and restrictions from external networks, such as barriers. MAC Filtering that allows/blocks access to specific MAC addresses, IP Filtering that controls access to specific external IPs, URL Filtering that blocks access to URLs with specific strings, and Port Filtering that blocks access to specific ports. In addition to the filtering function, we also implemented a Port Forwarding function that allows external access only to specific ports and forwards to specific internal IPs. The above functions were implemented as Linux applications to run Linux Kernel and were developed using C. In addition, Trigger was developed as Shell Script so that the application runs Linux Kernel. ��� WiFi Disk An WiFi disk that can use the File Storage function is implemented through a WiFi signal on that device. The UI was developed through CPE Web Page. Cgi and WiFi disk applications were implemented using C, and the File System Command for Linux was configured to be set through Shell Script. WiFi disk functions include File Upload, Download, Delete, Renaming, and Create Directory. In addition, a preview function was implemented to allow media files such as Image/Text/Audio/Movie to be previewed on the Web UI. During the implementation of this function, there was a problem that buffer memory overflow occurred when the file size attached to the Web Page was more than 1GB. The cause of the problem is that when files are transferred from the Client, they are divided by 256 bytes and then written to the memory at certain intervals after being accumulated in a temporary buffer on Linux, which was caused by Linux not being able to write to memory as quickly as the size of the transferred buffer. To solve this problem, the size of the transfer buffer for Lighttpd, which was used as a web application at the time, was modified from 256 bytes to 128 bytes. Since then, the problem has not occurred even if a 4GB file is sent. 3) OO Mobile App Development / OO / 2015.01 ~ 2015.07 - Service Introduction: It is a project to develop an O2O service for men's personal styling subscriptions. - Development Environment: [Java(Android), Node.js/Eclipse], [MySQL / MySQL WorkBench], [SVN / Subclipse] - Responsible Development: Complete Client Development, Middleware Server Development, DB Design and Construction ��� Network Manager module for Layout implementation according to Client Side UX design and communication with the server was developed through Android. In addition, we developed the data parsing structure of the public data Open API for delivery status and road name address information. In addition, it was linked with PG's payment system for payment. We developed Restful API service middleware server using ��� Server Side Node.js. For scalability and flexibility in service system management, Restful API definition and Json definition were documented. In addition, we built Server Hosting using Amazon AWS EC2. ��� DB member table and product table were organized into many-to-many relationships to efficiently manage information on purchase history. In addition, a one-to-many relationship was defined so that one stylist could be assigned to each member so that the information of the customer he/she manages can be checked at once on an app dedicated to the stylist. In addition, for the accuracy and reliability of payment for product purchases, we built a database through InnoDB's MySQL considering transition-safe. In addition, using Amazon AWS RDS, we used DB Server Hos"
"My major was mostly related to Java, JSP, and the web. I have experience in creating shopping mall sites using this. I believe that developers should always have an attitude to study. So, after graduating from college, I have completed an education on oracle db in external education, and also have experience in completing an education called vulnerability analysis through mock hacking. Based on various education and experience, I am ready to work at Hancom, and I plan to continue studying after joining the company. My strength is being creative. In the past, when I took a quiz to citizens and gave gifts to the correct answers. However, my participation rate was low, and I came up with an idea to successfully end the activity. Instead of giving a gift when I got the quiz right, I made some changes by giving it to the citizens first. Then, the citizens who received the gift did not turn away from us. We filled out all the number of people we wanted in just one hour. To achieve results, I have experience of enhancing efficiency by using creative ideas."" ""I had volunteer work while teaching children at Seongmin Social Welfare Center or Yeonmu Center during the 2013/14 vacation. The reason I started volunteering was that I left elementary school in the countryside when I was young, and I lacked a way to contact better learning. So I thought of volunteering to children who are in a difficult situation at home after entering university. So I came to provide after-school learning guidance to children at a social welfare center where many children in need come. I enjoyed the time to meet with children while volunteering, and I was even more happy if they understood the concept properly. Just as I was rewarded by helping children in need, I will work at Hancom and dream about the future of my life by helping customers, colleagues, and the company."",,,,"
"[Challenging to start a business to create something out of nothing!] Since I was young, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, fashion, etc. that others could not have imagined. When I saw my paintings, people around me were surprised and praised me for having unique ideas. I became interested in programming, which allowed me to express my unique ideas freely as if I were drawing on a canvas, and naturally I went on to major in computer science. I continued my interest in programming not only through my major learning but also through my activities as an app development club. By the time I was in my fourth year of college, I had a desire to develop a service through programming, and I set a goal of surprising the world by realizing my own unique idea into a real service. In order to develop a real service, I felt that my major knowledge alone was not enough, and I kicked out of the well called the school and entered T Academy, an educational institution for development professionals. By completing two courses by experts in Android and mobile servers at T Academy, I was able to develop enough services to actually implement them. As the first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago. We wanted to provide customers' trust and convenience through the operation method called 'Preliminary Payment After Payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'Preliminary Payment After Confirmation'. In addition, we tried to make it competitive with existing shopping malls through the concept of providing personalized styling services, and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women. This naturally led to the realization of individualized O2O styling services for men for the first time in the shopping mall industry, and returns and refunds were made at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up for SK Planet. [Lack of flexibility] However, despite these achievements, we had an unexpected difficulty while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem by ourselves. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code samples and manuals provided by payment PG were very different from the server platform Node.js, which I implemented, which made it difficult to implement. I tried to solve the problem through PHP programming books and Internet search, but I wasted five days. I eventually asked the payment PG for help through phone or e-mail, and when I found out that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a day, I felt a great letdown. When a problem arises through this opportunity, I try to solve the problem quickly by approaching anyone first, asking them, and learning. [Responsibility as much as a professional] Although there were many difficulties during service development due to these shortcomings, the responsibility of being 'the owner of the service is me' was the driving force that led to the commercialization of shopping mall services. It was not easy to develop the Front/Back-End of the service by myself because I was the only developer in a start-up team composed of various majors. However, this start-up started with my idea, and I devoted myself to the development, staying all night in the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of it. After these efforts, I was able to develop the service within the target period and successfully commercialize the service. The 'challenge' to surprise the world with my unique ideas, the 'pioneering spirit' that created the first men's personalized styling service for shopping malls, the 'patience' and 'responsibility' that I should not finish what I started, and the 'development capability as professionals' that developed the entire system front/back-end through the start-up of shopping malls. I will exert my utmost efforts to help Hana I&S be at the center of innovation in the Hana Financial Group by utilizing these five capabilities. ""I have worked as an intern for the last nine months at a company focused on producing LTE modem chips and developing solutions. During my internship, I participated in the firmware development project for the smart meter, one of the core technologies of smart grid. A smart meter is a digital electronic meter that transmits power usage data measured in real time in each home to an electric company through LTE signals. My role in this project was to implement a socket server that receives the power consumption data measured through the client application through socket communication. I was nervous because it was a relatively big task, but I made up my mind with the responsibility that I would implement it perfectly because my team members trusted me. Not long after I started developing the function I was in charge of, I encountered difficulties. When the socket server was initially implemented, in the process of accepting the client's connection request, the socket was created in a blocking structure. Because of this, if more than one client transmits packets at the same time, the server first receives only the packets from the client that created the socket and does not receive the packets from the rest of the clients. To solve this problem alone, the server tried to communicate with each client through Multi Thread when creating a socket with the client, but it showed not only rapid performance degradation but also unstable system behavior. Eventually, I couldn't solve it by myself and wasted three days. After suffering alone, I decided that it would have a big impact on the project deadline, so I explained the cause of the problem and what needed to be resolved to a senior developer in the team and asked for advice. By changing the part treated as a blocking structure to a Non-Blocking structure, I was advised by the senior developer to implement it as an asynchronous socket server, and the server code was modified. First, the blocking socket was changed to a non-blocking socket through the fcntl function. After that, the file descriptor (FD) change was detected through the select function before the recv function receiving packets from the client was called.This allows servers to receive packets from all clients simultaneously, even if a particular client's packet transfer is not complete or there is no data to send. The project gave us an accurate understanding of the structure and principles of socket communication, and by developing synchronous/asynchronous sockets ourselves, we have the ability to design and implement contextual socket structures. In addition, by developing socket servers ourselves, we have created a variety of development capabilities, including the ability to implement Linux applications, compiling in Linux environments, and managing source revision through SVN within team projects. I will use my full capabilities to become an IT employee with diverse and solid technology so that Hana I&S can become a leading smart finance player."",,,,"
"[Independence that provided an expensive experience!] I have always been independent since I was a child. That's why I always tried to do what I could do on my own, and I didn't rely on my parents as much as possible. Before entering college, I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but most of all, I didn't want to burden my parents with the financial burden, so I had to think about it a lot. As a result, after collecting a lot of information, I came to understand that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after an interview, I was able to work as a work scholarship. Looking back, the working life I did at large academies was the first step in society. Classes that require as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students were divided into roles, and before the class started, 20 students worked together to clean up, such as chalking for lectures and checking the status of microphones. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students usually came to take famous lectures. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms that had to be prepared overlapped. However, the scholarship students took the time to help each other, not only to do what they were assigned to do, but also to solve the shortage of manpower. While working as a student at a college for nearly a year, I was able to have valuable experience to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to work together. Even after entering college, I worked part-time and made some pocket money by myself and solved financial problems by myself. I am confident that the valuable experience and independence learned through the process of growth can strengthen the bond between students and create synergies, thereby enhancing the efficiency and contributing to the work.""[Responsibility! Leads everyone as representative of the department] After entering college, I became the representative when I was in the first year of the department. While playing a public role, I personally wanted to help my classmates. While listening to the class, I learned that classmates who entered the required liberal arts course called ""college mathematics"" from liberal arts in high school are having difficulty keeping up with the class. After thinking about how to help these students, I came to find a solution. We started to post the solutions on the cafe by solving the materials and problems that have been organized every week, and we posted and shared the organized materials so that friends in need can refer to it continuously. It was not easy because it was not a one-time event, but we exchanged information through the cafe without fail with a sense of responsibility. In addition, as other students who were good at math participated later on, they studied without giving up on ""college math"" and all of them in the same grade were able to get good results. As a developer, I have been properly utilizing the semester and the vacation period to build up my competence. First, we prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Club Introduction and Support"" in groups of two during the semester. The server was developed with the MVC structure jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period for submitting the results, I stayed until late at night during the period of planning the service to participate in the competition and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books. I proceeded with the project with tension because I had to complete and present during the three-month period while studying with two people. At this time, I was able to understand the concept of MVC structure and develop my ability to use Internet search. In addition, I was able to experience how the programming called Java, which I learned in school, was applied and used in the project. As a result of concentrating, I fell in love with it so passionately that the period seemed short, and I even received an unexpected award. And the sense of accomplishment came to me as a value more than effort. Second, during the vacation, I have intensively built up my competencies by doing external activities, free from the burden of classes and exams. While working on a project through an external club, I participated in the hackathon, which lasted for 2 nights and 3 days, and as a team, developers, designers, and planners teamed up to plan, complete the project, and demonstrate a service to share information on street performances. It was a valuable experience to realize that while creating a service in a short time, it is important to quickly implement it through your own technology, but it was also important to share roles that could achieve optimal efficiency and teamwork that helped each other as well as play their own roles. I'm sure that the consistently cultivated ability will quickly adapt as a family to ""entering school"" and become a person who will be able to become one and help others while performing his or her duties."",""""[Problem-solving ability through consideration and collaboration] I think that the basic skills that a developer must have are consideration and collaboration among team members. While working outside the company, I worked on a web project with majors from other universities. During the project, one of my team members suddenly left, causing a crisis, and everyone was confused. I thought that if left without resolving this situation quickly, the atmosphere of the team and the progress of the project would be loosened, and I suggested that I would do the role of the person who stepped forward. Everyone agreed with the opinion, and the other team members also showed positive attitude that they would do more than they were in charge of, and the atmosphere within the team quickly found vitality. There were some difficult parts due to the sudden increase in the number of parts to be done in the middle of the project, but we developed them together while maintaining tension, and we were able to safely complete the ""Men's Care Product Recommendation Service"" within a set schedule and show it at the demonstration. At this point, I learned that no matter what difficulties we face, we can overcome them by finding a solution together, and that team projects are important for individual abilities, but also for collaboration among team members."",,"
"[Developer looking for things he doesn't know until it is resolved] My strength is curiosity and problem solving ability. I am interested in technologies and trends that I use often in practice, so I talked about them with a friend who works in IT. One time, I heard a bug-related technology called log4j on the way home together. It is a technology that I use for sure in practice, but it was unfamiliar and I was curious about it at the time. I couldn't fall asleep because I was curious when I got home, so I turned on my laptop and looked for a well-organized site about log4j through the Internet, and the questions were solved, but as my questions were resolved, I wanted to apply them to my personal projects. While searching the Internet for information necessary to apply it and applying it to personal projects, I learned the trend of using it as a secured logback in recent log4j, and I applied it as a logback that day, organized it on my personal blog, and fell asleep. My passion and curiosity to ask and look for such questions until they are resolved is my differentiated strength. It came out for a while while talking, but if there is a problem while developing the web in Dana through the efforts and curiosity of finding it with interest, solving questions, and applying it to individual projects, I will contribute to the development of Dana and actively participate in the work through such capabilities. ""As a [challenging developer], I voluntarily participated in the development club and carried out the project during the vacation to build up my competence as a developer. During the semester, I tried to communicate through various experiences while challenging myself for a software competition. Among them, I was able to develop my skills through the competition and hackathon. During the semester, I prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Introduction and Support of Clubs"" in pairs. The server was developed with the MVC structure jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period of time to submit results, I stayed until late at night during the period when I was planning the service to participate in the competition and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books.

In addition, I participated in a hackathon for two nights and three days, and developed a web service that shared information about street performances with developers, designers, and planners through PHP, I developed my ability to quickly apply the language I studied. Through the capabilities that I have prepared like this, I am confident that I can quickly adapt to work and contribute to web development in Dana."",""""[Vacation-Development Group is a partnership!] Vacation created the greatest communication time to build capacity through the joint development club. Based on these times, I am currently working for ""Nextors,"" a web and app development club. There are two reasons why I became active in the ""Nexters"" club steadily. The first is that I can collaborate with designers that I did not have in school. Unlike the projects carried out by developers, I was able to broaden the range of perspectives and thoughts that I develop from the perspective of users by having a meeting with a designer who approaches UI. The second is that I have the opportunity to work with a developer who is an office worker who works in practice, not with a project between college student developers. While working on the project together, I was able to get an opportunity to learn new skills such as RSS parsing, and the completion of the project was high. While working, I worked on two projects, ""Taxi rides application"", acting as an app server by using a web service that allows you to view materials on the subject of interest through node.js."", [Voluntary challenge! Personal project!] I was interested in using RSS a lot around me, so I have done a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there was a problem that I had no experience with spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. In the case of spring, since it was my first time, I thought it would be good to receive reference materials and proceed with it, so I asked the professor to study the materials that seniors had conducted in class. While looking at the references, I set the overall framework, and I added functions to the framework by applying content that is not in the references, such as sending emails through gmail, through Internet search. During the project, I solved the obstruction by looking at the answers and materials left on the community sites from the Internet search. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS through search and asked my acquaintances while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looked it up and found that fetching information through RSS was a kind of parsing. After learning that it was a kind of parsing, I searched for materials centered on the keyword parsing and found out that there are many libraries for parsing. We found a library suitable for the java environment, selected and decided to use one called Jsoup, and tested it. In the end, we succeeded in using the Jsoup library to get the information we wanted through RSS and use it in the format we wanted. After importing and processing the information, I used it from the user's point of view, and I thought it was uncomfortable to see, click, and go to the article page.So, I thought it would be effective to implement a paragraph summary algorithm and apply it to the contents of the article so that the core contents of the article can be understood only by the summarized contents. I decided to implement a paragraph summary algorithm, and I thought about the logic of the algorithm while searching on the Internet under the keyword paragraph summary. In the end, the logic of the paragraph summary was implemented so that the key paragraphs could be found by checking the frequency of the words in the article and prioritizing the paragraphs with the words with the highest frequency. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to get the desired results by solving them one by one. While working on this project, I could feel that passion and testing from the user's point of view are also important. I was able to see the earnestness and importance of the project because I was passionate about the part that I was unfamiliar with the technology called spring and RSS, but I looked for and asked until it was resolved. When I thought about the part I did not know at the time of development from the user's point of view, I was able to find the complement point of paragraph summary, and I could feel that it was important to consider both the user's position while developing. This project is the result of these two things. As such, I will keep in mind what I felt this time and not forget it."
"I think there is a great potential for the development of financial it. Recently, the domestic financial industry has eased a lot of regulations on it, but it is being incorporated in various ways. So I thought that the job of financial it has a great potential for development and that I will be able to expand my capabilities. The new future of financial it, which is the vision of Lotte Capital, is like a dream that I want to achieve in my job. Lotte Capital's goal is to develop new and diverse financial products using information and communication technology to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby enhancing the benefits of society as a whole, and I applied to Lotte Capital because I thought it would be great if I could demonstrate my capabilities and support them. I will try to exert a higher synergy effect by adding Lotte Capital's capabilities, such as segmented financial products and leased products, and my capabilities in business administration/it. I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I began to study far away. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, he said, ""I believe in you. I was able to work with my family because I believed in you. He said, ""Don't trust me in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. However, I lacked the basics and I spent a year in re-employment after my third year of high school. There is something I gained by successfully spending that year. It is self-control. I studied according to the set rules every day for a year. It was very difficult to study a set time and a set amount every day. But I thought it was a promise to myself and I studied hard for a year. So I think I gained high self-control through re-employment. I have developed a strong mental strength to overcome long project tasks or intense tasks in my job at Lotte Capital it."" [When you think about them from a customer's point of view, the answer is visible] I have experience in solving problems within a group by thinking about them from a customer's point of view. In the first semester of my third year of college, I participated in a group of supporters run by the Korea Copyright Commission. During the group's activities, our team wrote a quiz about promotions on a panel that we produced ourselves. Our plan was to give out self-made gifts only to citizens who took the quiz. However, the planned day was humid and hot, so the citizens were not interested in us. So I told my team members that I needed to change my plan. My plan was not to give them a gift if they got the quiz right, but to give them a gift first and give them a quiz. However, one of the team members objected, saying that if that happens, they will not receive a quiz confirmation and only the gift will be wasted. My team member was right, too. There was a high possibility that only gifts would be wasted. However, I expected that citizens would not easily walk away if they received the gift first. So to persuade my team members, I held the panel by myself and said I would do the mission for 30 minutes. Then, the team members who opposed said they would approve if the performance was higher. I proceeded the mission in the way I thought, and the result was twice as good as the previous method. Then, the team members who opposed agreed with me and completed the mission together. It was my experience to identify the problem, find the cause, and find a solution accordingly. In the case of it job, reading ability and the ability to find the problem quickly are important. I will use the analysis power gained from this experience to help Lotte Capital."""", and ""As a graduate of the Department of Management Information, I have gained knowledge in business administration, SQL, and JAVA. In particular, SQL performed the task of constructing a report card system using MSSQL and acquired theoretical and practical skills by listening to both DB introduction and management theory. Another major, Business Process Management Theory and System Analysis and Design, helps design a logical process flow in the process of development. In February 2016, I studied DB architecture by completing the Oracle Database: 11g Introduction to SQL/Workshop I / II curriculum for a total of 120 hours. I have learned about memories related to the methods to consider in order to create an efficient SQL statement. Currently, I am preparing an information security technician, and at the same time, I am gaining knowledge about security by taking a three-month curriculum called 'Diagnosis of Vulnerabilities through simulated hacking'. I have the advantage of being able to understand the other person's intentions well. When I was a scout intern, I was asked to do short research in a short time. Although I didn't have enough time, I set my own standards and researched them according to my priorities. Through this experience, I will find and deal with tasks with a high priority among many tasks first. On the other hand, my weakness is the lack of efficient time distribution for many tasks. I learned this at university, and after that, I put a time limit on one task. So, when there is a set time, I perform other tasks to prevent myself from being overly immersed in one task. These efforts have resulted in fewer mistakes even when I have to deal with tasks at the same time."" First of all, at the beginning of the job, I will focus on obtaining the information security technician certificate that I am currently preparing, and then figure out the tasks and think about how I can melt what I learned in the department class and external education into my tasks. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also create experiences in the business together. Due to the nature of financial it, it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you don't know how other departments' tasks are handled. In addition, we will actively engage in exchanges with other teams in the it sector, where there are even four it teams, to promote the unity of the it team and to enable higher work efficiency and information sharing due to the synergy effect.The it job always has to think about optimal efficiency and how to reduce cost and time in the process. I think that in order to do this, the it team has to have more information about other departments and also share more information among it teams."",,,,"
"Samsung SDS is the most notable company in the domestic ICT industry with its own development solutions. It introduced the concept of fourth-party logistics and provides a single global logistics service. As such, Samsung SDS is exceeding the limits of ICT companies with the spirit of leading Samsung. In addition, as an ICT service company, it is contributing a lot to society to solve the emerging information gap problem. I really want to get an opportunity to work for Samsung SDS, which goes beyond the limits of the ICT industry and at the same time returns value to society. I am also studying CCNA/CCNP, a network expert course, from July this year to overcome my limitations. It is because I thought that just as engineers need humanities knowledge, humanities need practical knowledge. In particular, as I prepared for employment, my interest in IT technology, which was most closely related to my real life, grew. As I study networks, I am learning that the technologies used in real life are composed of various algorithms. In addition, I am learning how to solve problems in a troubleshooting manner, not a humanities problem-solving method. With my network knowledge and SCSA, I want to become a security expert. It is predicted that the use of IT security will become even more important in the Internet of Things (IOE) era. As a security expert, I want to create a standardized management system like the cello of Samsung SDS. Through this, I will not only generate revenue but also make sure that the world's IT technologies are used safely."" ""I loved answering and presenting in class. Discussions with various friends were also fun. In order to improve my presentation and discussion, I became interested in logic. In order to develop my logic, I took the course of Formal Logic. In addition, I learned a book called ""Local Thinking"" with the recommendation of my professor in order to develop logic that can be used in practice. After that, I am interested in solving logical problems and read related books. In order to participate in solution development, logic is essential. In the process of collaborating on solution development, I need logic to support my opinion. Also, logic finds the root causes of various problems and helps solve problems. I will be a member of Samsung SDS that presents opinions and solves problems based on this logic. It was when I was studying after entering college. I wondered if I was a person with good personality. I wondered if I was ready to go out into society and communicate with others without prejudice. I started a bath service for the disabled by joining the disabled bath service club Happy Bubble. Bath service for the disabled was not an easy task. It was also traumatizing to see a disabled person naked for the first time. It was very difficult physically to bathe a disabled person who could not move. While volunteering for the disabled for more than a year, I talked with them a lot. I felt that I was a person who had the same concerns as me, such as family, romance, and work. I was able to talk with them, sympathize with them, and make friends with the disabled. Through the bath service for the disabled, I was able to feel the joy of sacrificing and giving to myself. In addition, I felt the importance of giving away prejudice and sincerely communicating as if I were naked through volunteer activities. I would like to share my heart and communicate with various stakeholders including team members at Samsung SDS. In addition, through communication with customers, I will become an employee who provides the services that customers really want at Samsung SDS. The field in which my major, the humanities, is most in the spotlight is ironically in the IT field. And it was world-leading IT companies such as Google and Facebook that started to emphasize the humanities. Google and Facebook have something in common. These companies have abandoned their stereotypes from the perspective of developers. They have created an environment where users can use them more conveniently from their perspective. This change of perspective enabled them to survive the fierce competition. And at the center was the humanities perspective. In this respect, I think the convergence of IT technology and the humanities is very important. The areas that Samsung SDS is investing in as future growth engines have in common is convergence. ""I want to develop a service that takes advantage of the values of convergence at Samsung SDS."" ""In the global shipbuilding industry, Japan regained the top spot in monthly orders in January 2015 for the first time in six years and eight months. In February 2016, Samsung Heavy Industries ranked third in the world in terms of backlog of orders, giving Imabari Shipbuilding another third. The shipbuilding industry is considered one of the most important industries in the Korean economy because there are many projects linked to the front and rear and it has a significant impact on the local economy. The Japanese shipbuilding business, which had a global market share of less than 10%, was able to regain its global ranking because it continuously invested in new technologies and improved productivity through two major restructuring to cope with the recession after the oil shock in the 1970s. In the case of Imabari Shipyard, it established a shipyard specializing in LNG and worked hard to develop technologies such as developing eco-friendly ships. At the same time, the Japanese government encouraged restructuring, such as providing up to 80% of the ship price of the merged company at an interest rate of just 1%, and provided funding in consideration of the characteristics of the shipbuilding industry, which can easily fall into a liquidity crisis due to its low capital turnover. In Korea, STX, formerly ranked fourth in the world in shipbuilding, is also reducing 800 people through legal management and securing stable profits through business restructuring and streamlining orders. Judging from the cases of STX in Japan and Korea, I think the following efforts are needed for the shipbuilding business, the main industry in Korea, to dominate the global market. First, human and business restructuring should be carried out to improve the fundamental constitution to improve productivity.Second, we need to increase technological development. Through this, we need to secure stable profits in the future. Third, we need appropriate support from the government to secure liquidity. Through these three efforts, I believe that we will be able to secure the competitiveness of the domestic shipbuilding industry in foreign countries, and through these efforts, we will be able to have a positive impact on the local economy, exports and employment."",,,,"
"When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With a combination of English and letters full of screens, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and had a vague dream of majoring in computers. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream, but I was just stuck in learning unfamiliar languages and theories. At this time, what came to mind was a lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind. First, I sat at the front of the classroom and actively asked questions, participated, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I had never understood caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate projects and projects. As I served not only the professor but also the seniors actively, I found myself developing my ego outside of study. It was only then that I understood the lessons of my alma mater, which I had never understood in high school, and from then on, I became my values. Since then, I have been learning with a low attitude while serving a big person. I attended the CES 2013 held in Las Vegas. I experienced new IT technologies from world-class companies at the CES, the world's largest electronics exhibition. It was an opportunity to look at many companies and feel that unless they settle for the current performance and make progress, they will lose their competitiveness and will be eliminated. Since then, I have always kept the two words ""development"" in mind while running. My goal is to strive to achieve my childhood dream of becoming an IT person through my values and words in my heart. After joining BC Card, I will reflect on my values and continue to improve and show myself to become a great person by serving senior citizens and customers from a low attitude to achieve my dream. ""Since trust given to customers in the payment and settlement industry is related to the company's status, I have to make constant efforts to build trust. Based on that trust, BC Card is a leading company in the industry, but I think we need to build more trust to become No. 1 in Asia payment services. The IT sector does not directly give that trust. However, I believe that by providing good services such as web pages and mobile devices, I can build trust in people indirectly. I want to become an IT employee who indirectly builds trust in BC Card. After joining the company, I will quickly learn necessary qualities such as accurate understanding of the program I am in charge of and acquiring financial knowledge, grow into an IT finance expert, and provide services suitable for BC Card. In addition, I will constantly understand IT technology trends and apply new technologies to existing IT services to make efforts for better IT services. And as the head of BC Card's IT department within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial computer in Korea."" At the time of OOO internship, I had to modify the network due to the need to change the test environment. Although a large-scale change was needed, I had a fear that it would be impossible because it was not given to wires and equipment, perhaps due to the environment that I had maintained for a long time. However, by joining forces with my motives, I decided to introduce and change a new systematic method, and I decided to proceed with the work using both. 1. RackTables tool 2. I thought that it would be easy for others to change the environment later if I changed it using two methods of physical cycles. I wrote the cycle and tool while going back and forth to the server room and checking the line directly over the phone. As a result, I built the desired test environment. If I had done it alone, I might have given up thinking it was impossible, but I think I got good results as I ran with the team members. Through teamwork, I learned that anything can be solved if I proceed with goals and how to solve things. During the school festival in 2012, a bar was held in Somoim, but there was a situation where the delivery of the festival items I ordered was delayed. I received a customer on time because I thought that the goods would naturally arrive at the time I reserved, but when I called, I had to wait a little bit. I couldn't betray the customer's expectations, so I went to Somoim next to talk about the necessary items and started trading. We were the only ones who rented sound equipment, but instead of borrowing the necessary items, they asked us to rent it for a certain amount of time. Since I couldn't disappoint my customers, I decided to lend them to them with responsibility and the deal was concluded. However, due to the nature of the sound and atmosphere, other consumption items became an atmosphere where they could enjoy together from the beginning, and when it came time to promise, other consumption items said that this was enough and did not have to lend them. Based on trust, I came to think about the importance of trust, creating the effect of two trillion won in keeping promises with customers and learning cooperation through transactions."" Currently, the card industry is in an essential position in finance with the cooperation of banks and securities as its usage has increased more than cash. I want to grow from the IT department in the card industry to develop with future technologies, beyond simple cards, to become a financial IT person, and I have prepared two competencies. First, among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important thing was the basic IT competency, so I wanted to have a firm domain for my major in computer. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills such as Database and C. Java. In addition, I completed training on the web, Java, and DB through the DB Employment Academy training, and proceeded with the project. The second is the ability to improve service quality. OO intern wanted to find and manage bugs through HW and SW QA and provide stable quality products to customers. We tried to grow the program by supplementing TestCase, not just finding bugs.""���,,,"
"I was so interested in Linux that I was told that the combination of MYSQL and Linux was the best while studying. That story made me curious about MYSQL and the database, and I started studying. Since it is the last semester, I am studying while taking a database course with curiosity and enthusiasm for learning despite people around me asking me to leave as much time as possible to prepare for employment. The study, which started with curiosity, has turned into a joy of getting to know the database as time goes by, and I am only studying DB like a racehorse running while looking ahead. I think I need to be in the best group in order to be the best in one field, so it is not an exaggeration to say that all the information in Korea passes, and I saw the announcement on the job category that best fits my passion for my DB and network, and above all, I was encouraged to apply for passion. I think I can become the best DB expert in Korea, combined with my passion for DB, if I have the opportunity to learn about databases such as MYSQL and MongoDB from Kakao, which has the technology and data to connect people and the world beyond the limits of time and space, and make it happen, and I will do my best to make Kakao the most advanced company not only in Korea but also in the world. [Efforts for Growth] As of July 2015, I finished my sixth semester and became qualified for the article test. My goal was to get an information processing technician, information security technician, and Linux Master 1 level certificate during the second half of the year. Starting with basic information processing technicians, information security technicians to learn more about security and networks, and to study Linux, which is essential in the network sector. I was told by people around me to prepare one thing with certainty, but I started with the idea that I should do it. I prepared for the test by studying the overlapping operating system and network part first, and the additional part of the test ahead of the test date. I studied by reducing my bedtime and using my free time because I studied at the same time as my school class and part-time job, and although I was tired, I was more happy to know things I didn't know because I studied my favorite field. The unsatisfactory results were final pass for information processing technician, written pass for information security technician, and fail for Linux master, but I found that if I work hard with a mindset that I can do even if the result is not satisfactory, I can learn and feel a lot in the process. However, I will try harder to achieve satisfactory results from now on, and I passed the Linux Master Writing Test and am preparing for the Linux Master Practical Test and the Information Security Technician Practical Test in May. My next goal is to pass the recruitment of new employees for Kakao's Global Database Product. I think the greatest genius among geniuses is the genius of hard work. I will become a genius in my efforts and utilize all my capabilities for the development of Kakao."" [SafeRiding] I worked as a team to create a graduation work and proceeded with the project. My team used SafeRiding to combine RaspberryPi, Arduino, and Application to prevent drivers' safety accidents and theft of bicycles with functions such as rear detection using a camera and object detection using ultrasonic waves. I was in charge of RaspberryPi. Two-way communication through RaspberryPi of data values received using various sensors such as Arduino's ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, and gyro sensors, as well as through the input of applications and GPS values should have been possible. With RaspberryPi as the server, which serves as the middle bridge, communication control between Arduino and the application, and at the same time, I assisted in the programming of RaspberryPi. I used Python and Bash Script for the programming of RaspberryPi, which is based on Linux. After many meetings and tests on which communication technology should be used to enable the most optimized communication, we decided to communicate with Arduino using Bluetooth for communication with the application and Web-Streaming for Cam Streaming. It was our first time to encounter the equipment, technologies, and languages used, and we studied each technology before proceeding with the project, filling in the gaps. In the initial test, Bluetooth programming was performed on two-way communication, but it was a problem because communication was not achieved due to overlapping channels. And even in Web-Streaming, when I accessed the URL directly from the web, I saw a video, but there was a problem that was not visible in the application. I tried many things, such as changing and re-creating the code of the Bluetooth connection program, but it was not easy to solve it. Meanwhile, while I was looking at the code step by step from the beginning, I realized that the problem was really only one sentence of the code. With that, I learned how important each code I write in programming is. The problem in Web-Streaming was solved by coding in a format other than the first code I wrote because it was difficult to find which part was wrong, although the video was properly displayed in RaspberryPi. [Experience and Learning] When I was working as an office assistant at the election committee in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, the manager suggested early voting machines and networks and gladly accepted it.I was in charge of training the employees and part-timers of each dong office on how to install and operate the equipment, and conducting and guiding tests in preparation for the day of voting. The test was conducted by checking the connection log and controlling network traffic in Gangseo-gu, and if there was a problem, the network equipment of the polling station was re-examined. Thirty minutes before the start of the early voting, I was briefed on encrypted USB execution and network connection problems in two dongs where there were no problems, and my manager and I went to the polling station respectively. Since I didn't have time to check the problem, I explained to the manager over the phone, and at the same time, I was able to set up and encrypt the hub after replacing it, and I was able to start voting on time. I think that if the skills I learned while managing the network at the district level and learning at Kakao are combined, I think I will be a talented person worthy of Kakao,,,"
"[Growing up with Daewon Pharmaceutical] I have accumulated overall IT knowledge by taking various courses such as HW, SW, and network when I was an undergraduate. In addition, I have acquired basic qualifications as an IT expert by not stopping at lectures, working on various projects, obtaining information processing technicians, and CCNA certificates. I applied because I thought that my capabilities and interests could create synergy with Daewon Pharmaceutical. When selecting a company that is another starting point in my life, I think about whether it is a company that can grow continuously rather than the current situation. In this regard, Daewon Pharmaceutical does not stay in the present, but has a firm goal of 'living a healthy life for the people' and achieving 500 billion won', and I think that there are more ways to go than there have been in the future. In order to grow with Daewon Pharmaceutical like this, I will first become a new employee who is concerned about the operation management of network and server systems and the achievement of goals based on a complete understanding of the internal processes of Daewon Pharmaceutical. Based on this, I will become a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, which keeps its promise of maximizing customer value, with better changes occurring with my colleagues every year. [passion leading to responsibility] I have the advantage of being active in anything with the tenet of 'Everything has learning.' During college, I actively built up my IT knowledge, and while riding, I learned physical strength and persistence. Like this, I am committed to doing my best in anything. This kind of strength has always been the driving force that makes me do my best with a sense of responsibility. This driving force has been the power to push ahead with work and produce results when working on team projects. These strengths and driving forces greatly help Daewon Pharmaceutical's growth and I am confident that they will lead to results. On the other hand, my supplementary point is that I often hear the tired voices of my team members when working on team projects due to my too-active attitude. To compensate for this, I am solving this problem by communicating with my team members and taking a break through meals and drinking parties. As a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, I will become an employee who actively engages in anything with responsibility. I will also demonstrate synergy of cooperation by communicating with my colleagues frequently."""" and ""[Talented human resources that Daewon Pharmaceutical is looking for] I have made various efforts to become a human resource that meets the expectations of society as well as Daewon Pharmaceutical, which prioritizes 'customer satisfaction'. First, I have acquired not only knowledge of network and database but also knowledge of server in my major classes and private IT institutions. In particular, I was more interested in Network, my major field, and obtained a CCNA certificate, which qualified me as a network manager and gave me the basics. Second, during my undergraduate years, I conducted Term Projects related to my major, and through this, I developed meticulousness and meticulous analysis. When errors were found in coding within the project, I analyzed them line by line with my colleagues and completed the project by debugging until I found them. Such meticulousness and meticulousness could lead to achievements and led to a strong sense of responsibility. Rather than staying in these competencies, I will continue to develop more expertise in the network field and obtain a CCNP certificate. In addition, I will become a talented person who grows up with Daewon Pharmaceutical by preparing information security technicians to become IT professionals who can cope with security issues."",""[Searching for alternatives] When a road collapsed due to heavy rain during the long journey of bicycle country, I safely traveled to my destination in search of alternatives to meet the schedule with my members. In the summer of 2014, I visited the long journey of 700 km from Haenam to Seoul on the national highway rather than the bicycle path. During the long journey, a heavy rain caused the road to collapse. As a result, I was unable to safely travel to the accommodations I had reserved, and all my colleagues started to tremble. I spent the day safely with some of the staff, and went around looking for areas where I could proceed with my next schedule, and fortunately, I decided to get accommodations provided at a nearby cathedral on condition of cleaning up. In addition, other fees were contacted in advance and even a patrol car was recruited so that I could proceed safely. Although I felt heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt that we were able to proceed without anyone getting hurt thanks to all of our efforts, so I was lighthearted. As mentioned above, I want to be one member of the group in which we, not one person, join forces to solve problems."",""""[If there is no first step, there is no second step."" During my undergraduate years, I worked for the English conversation club ""AVES"" and participated in the ""Chungcheong-do University Student English Speech Contest."" As I studied in the natural world and engineering college, I was afraid of English because I only dealt with numbers, formulas, and sensors rather than foreign languages. So, I joined an English conversation club on campus, talked in English twice a week, and had games and discussions. Although I got used to English through club activities, I still had my fears. Meanwhile, I learned about the ""Chungcheong-do University Student English Speech Contest"" hosted by the school and decided to participate in it. In the process of choosing a theme and writing Korean manuscripts and translating English, my fears gradually disappeared. After all, I successfully completed my English speech in the first order on the day of the contest after much effort. Although I did not win the prize, it was an opportunity to get rid of my fear of English and start studying English. This opportunity continues to this day, and I am attending English conversation studies every morning along with studying English such as TOEIC and Opic. As a member of Daewon Pharmaceutical, I will become a talented person who does not fear failure and grows based on continuous challenges."",,,,"
"[No one knows our department] I want to make sure that no one knows the existence of our IT operation department. The most obvious thing about the existence of the IT operation department is when there is an IT problem. If there is no IT problem, no one will visit the IT department. I want to provide a stable IT environment to other departments through stable IT operation so that it does not interfere with their work, so that the IT operation department does not emerge as a concern. To this end, we will try to minimize inconvenience by understanding the characteristics of work of not only the IT operation department but also other departments by considering their perspectives. [Solving even minor problems] We developed a 'chat program using COM ports' as an undergraduate project. At that time, a code to send packets was given, but if you use that code as it is, the latter part of the message did not send well if the message was longer than a certain length. The code part was given as a basic, so it did not affect the task score, but I analyzed the cause to solve this problem. The problem occurred due to the speed difference between SW and HW, and to solve this problem, we solved the problem through a delay between message transmissions. In the end, I was able to get a good grade called A+ by solving the only problem. In this way, I will become a talented person who solves even the smallest problem without overlooking it and prepares other departments of Hanwha Life to avoid any problems. ""I am a person who enjoys challenging myself. When setting goals, I always defiantly set goals and enjoy the process of reaching them. I have experience in creating a 'similar torrent program' as an undergraduate class assignment. The assignment was to produce a 'file transfer program', but since the score was set on a relative basis based on the function and completeness of the program, I decided to develop a torrent program rather than a simple file transfer program. However, to do this, I was short on time to learn many knowledge such as file distribution principles, file processing, transmission protocols, and multiple threads. So, I organized the knowledge I needed to learn, made a learning plan, and studied the knowledge necessary for development step by step. Various examples were analyzed by referring to the Internet and books, and applied to the program's development. When using multiple threads during development, things did not go as I wanted, so I visited my assistant and got help for 3 hours, and when using TCP/IP protocol, I hung on for 10 hours to solve the problem. After many trials and errors, I successfully developed the program and achieved good result, ranking first in assignment grade. From this, I learned that setting challenging goals is not smooth, but when I reach them, great achievements come along, and since then, I have set challenging goals that are beyond my ability and have been making great efforts to achieve them."" When I was a re-taker, I happened to meet Kim Tae-won, the author of Young Googler's Letter to the Dead Passion, on the subway. This book was given as a gift from my homeroom teacher when I was in high school, but I did not just receive the gift and read it. Before we met on the subway and parted five stops later, Kim gave me heartfelt advice, telling me about his re-taking experience. Kim's advice comforted me, who was discouraged. That night, I read the book I received from my teacher from the beginning. In the book, Kim emphasizes passion. The passion that he does not practice is just a piece of hot water, and the qualification is not to fill in with English scores or awards, but to how passionately he lived the given time. After reading the book, I was deeply impressed, and it gave me a chance to focus on my studies again, so I successfully completed my re-examination. Even when I came to college, I tried to have various experiences for myself in the future, not just for a line of my resume. Sometimes, when I feel like my passion has cooled down and I feel lethargic, I take out the book and calm myself by rereading it. Even now, several years later, the meeting was an unforgettable turning point in my life. I will not work passively, but to become a talented person who deals with the passion of my heart."", ""Can't everyone use it easily?"" When I was in the sixth grade of elementary school, I accidentally purchased a PC magazine at a bookstore and became attracted to computers. As I often fixed the computers of my acquaintances thanks to my interest in computers, I found that computers have already come deep into our lives, but most people cannot easily handle them. Since then, my dream has become to make computers easy for everyone. This dream led to various mentoring programs during my undergraduate years. I participated in mentoring programs for non-majors and tutoring programs for international students to help them learn by delivering my accumulated know-how and major knowledge. In addition, I found out that my parents use the music playback app on their smartphones, but they are not familiar with the interface, making it difficult to use it. To solve this problem, I developed my own music playback app with a more intuitive interface. I researched the inconveniences of using existing apps for the elderly, including parents and uncles who are not familiar with machines, and I developed the app that has an interface that is easy for anyone to operate by reflecting this. After development, I received and supplemented the feedback to create a music playback app that is easy for people who are not familiar with machines to use. As such, Hanwha Life Insurance will also make an effort to provide a stable IT environment to other departments through my will to make computers easy for everyone to use,,,"
"[World Standard Bank] When I was an undergraduate at HW, SW, and Network, I was most fascinated by Network. Network makes all companies more active in their business activities and ensures a more convenient life for ordinary people as well. In order to become an expert on this network, I obtained the CCNA license and checked the virtual network with my own eyes during the acquisition process to deepen my understanding. I applied because I thought that these capabilities and interests could create synergy with SC Bank. I think a company is another starting point in my life. So, when choosing a company, I think about whether it is a company that can sustainable growth rather than just look at the current situation. In this respect, SC Bank is not only complacent about the current financial transactions, but also has an innovative goal of Digital Main Bank, and I think there are more ways to go than there have been in the future. In order to grow with such a SC bank, I will be a new employee who considers network and server system operation management and achievement of goals based on a thorough understanding of internal processes of SC bank for one year after joining the company. In addition, I will focus on understanding database so as not to neglect DATA management, and take a step closer to Digital Main Bank by obtaining DBA certificate. I will do my best to operate the system so that I can become a leader as Digital Main Bank of Korea in five years. In addition, I will be interested in ways to make more active business with not only domestic but also foreign partners through continuous development of SC bank system. In 10 years, as one of the executives of SC bank, I will proceed with the project to think about the new 10 years by establishing a network system so that financial activities that go through SC can be conducted all over the world. I will become an SC person who keeps my promise to maximize customer value, with better changes occurring with my colleagues every year.""[Carefully] My superpower is meticulous analysis with my colleagues. When I was in college, I worked on a project with Raspberry Pi through a course called Internet communication design. Through the progress of the project, I learned the power of teamwork and the need for careful analysis. The theme of our team was 'library seat system'. However, we added a led notification function and a web seat management function that informs users of the seat end time, not only to imitate the current library system. We divided our parts and proceeded with coding. I was in charge of controlling the seat display LED through socket communication. At first, we thought that we could derive and synthesize the results for each part, so we performed coding work separately. When I combined the socket communication coding I was in charge of with the coding brought by the other team members, there was an error in coding because parts were not harmonized. Perhaps due to repeated errors, all of the team members were tired. However, we analyzed the coding in detail to get good grades by completing the project. As a result of analyzing the entire coding line by line, and organizing the errors, we were able to complete the project. If it weren't for the team members, I would have been frustrated and wanted to give up by myself. Also, I was able to produce results thanks to careful analysis, checking even the smallest 'dot' and analyzing it carefully. Through my superpower, I will become an employee who achieves my goals and grows even more with SC."""" and ""[Talent qualified for SC] I have made various efforts to become a talented person who meets the expectations of society as well as SC Bank's management policy of 'to be with you all the time."" First, I have acquired not only network and database knowledge but also server knowledge in my major classes and private IT institutions. In particular, I was more interested in Network, my major, and obtained a CCNA certificate, which qualified me as a network manager and equipped me with basic skills. Second, during my undergraduate years, I conducted a Term Project related to my major, and through this, I developed meticulousness and meticulous analysis. When errors were found in the coding in the project, I analyzed them line by line and completed the project by debugging until I found them. Such meticulousness and meticulousness could lead to achievements and led to a strong sense of responsibility. Third, it is the ability to smoothly solve problems no matter what problems arise outside of my expertise. When my schedule was disrupted by a heavy rain caused by the collapse of a road during the long journey of bicycle country in my undergraduate years, I looked for alternatives to meet the schedule and had my members safely get to their destinations. As a staff member, I was obliged to ensure the safety of my team members, so I was worried that the roads would be cut off and that I might not be able to go to the accommodations I had reserved. With the permission of the team leader, I looked for the fastest way to proceed as scheduled and a school that could rent a playground or auditorium. Fortunately, I was contacted by a nearby cathedral that they would provide accommodation for cleaning, so I was able to recruit a patrol car and proceed with the schedule. Even though I was heavier while running around looking for a solution, I felt light because I was able to continue without anyone getting hurt. As such, I remain active for the safety of everyone outside of my area of expertise. I am confident that these are qualities that satisfy all of us, including our customers, through the operation of SC Bank's system."" [First Mover: SC] SC Bank is considered the first mover in the financial industry. Recently, I read a book called 'First Mover' by Peter Underwood. First Mover means ""leader of new field."" The reason why SC Bank thought 'First Mover' was because it was the fastest to go digital. Most of the business processing in many fields, including financial affairs, is carried out by the computer, network, database, etc. It is expected that more IT technologies will be deployed without changing this trend.Although its main business is finance, it is preparing for the future by hiring IT professionals such as Network, Server, and Data. We expect that such thorough preparations will show great efficiency in the ongoing operation of the Bank Shop. In addition, we will be able to grow one step further if we have more safety in this simpler financial market. If we continue to pay attention to IT investment as well as financial security issues, I think these can be directly related to customer satisfaction. I am confident that the energy of customer satisfaction will enable us to reach Digital Main Bank, which SC Bank has aimed for, as soon as possible, and become a leader in the financial industry.""[Capstone Design: Making Air Conditioners by Infrared Temperature Measurement] I have experience creating works that participate in the design of Capstone for my graduation work in college. The work we produced was an infrared temperature sensor for an air conditioner. The goal was to place it in front of the desk for office workers in Korea, which has the second largest working hours in the world, and to operate the air conditioner in accordance with the temperature. The base controls hardware parts such as motors and temperature sensors in Arduino, and Bluetooth communication with the database in Raspberry Pi, so that the cooler operates according to the current temperature values and adjusts the strength and weakness. In addition, the measured current temperature values can be viewed on the web in conjunction with php so that users can monitor them in real time. Among them, I was in charge of the Bluetooth communication part that transmits temperature values from Arduino to Raspberry Pi, the current temperature values measured by Arduino in myadmin, the database built by Arduino, and the part that transmits and expresses the current temperature values to php (web). Among them, the most memorable part was about the database. In this process, we executed an Insert command that communicates serial with a port number and inserts the data received through the 'execute' command into the database. These commands were theoretically learned through a subject called database design, but I was very interested because it was the first time to build and input values through communication. As such, just because my major is a network, I am not limited to a network, but I have gained knowledge of the database and implemented it myself through projects. Through my network and database capabilities, I will be a very helpful employee in the operation of the SC information system.""���,,,"
"[A person who communicates with the outside world] I am considerate and have excellent harmony skills, so I can increase the efficiency of the team by leading the team members in a comfortable atmosphere and speaking freely. In the software analysis design subject, we analyzed and designed services by applying object-oriented design patterns. Our group created a service that allows people to participate in donations and volunteer activities, and we created a blueprint by applying GRASP and GOF patterns. With my unique positive energy, I made the group atmosphere amicable, and my teamwork improved, so the work efficiency increased. Even if I invested the same amount of time, I was able to work more efficiently compared to other groups, and I ended up winning first place in the project. Even after I came to university, I served as an executive of a club called 00 that shines, and I am called the godmother of 00 because I have a wide network of connections and are close friends there. [Those who contribute to the growth of the organization] When I served as an executive of club 00, I wanted to be helpful to the club, so I tried to solve the employment problem, which was a concern for many members. To this end, in order to create a place for information exchange with seniors who are active in the field, the OBYB meeting, which had been abolished, was revived. There were many negative reactions that they would fail, and there were times when I wanted to give up because I couldn't reach the seniors. However, he said that he was able to hold the event because he believed that he could, and that it was a satisfactory time for both seniors and juniors. It is rewarding to see that I contribute to the growth of the organization and the members of the organization feel satisfied because of me. If I join Hansol Group, I will be the person who leads the company on a better path with this mindset.""[Success story: The spirit of not knowing how to give up] **When I was an intern at Electronics, I successfully developed the return scanner, and I stopped giving up thinking about my joy after success even though I had a hard work. Although it was a short internship, I wanted to learn a lot and challenged the development task. My task was to develop a return scanner that would allow the scanner motor to scan not only when it departs from home but also when it returns to reduce the time it takes to scan. I had to analyze the code that was actually used, but it was very difficult because it was large and complicated. However, the harder it was, the more I burned down, and I did not give up, imagining after success whenever I had a hard time. I analyzed the code flow, drew a flowchart, and tried to understand the functions and variables I studied by organizing them in documents. Every time I corrected the code one by one, a new error occurred, but it was a fun time, and I was very happy when the development was successful. With this opportunity, I did not give up no matter how difficult I took on the difficult task. Even after joining Hansol Group, I will be willing to challenge difficult tasks by utilizing my strengths, and I will succeed in my work with a spirit that does not know how to give up. [Failure Case: Realizing the Importance of Collaboration] I was working on a project dealing with ARM-based embedded equipment, and I received a mid-low grade, and I learned the importance of collaboration at this opportunity. All the members of the group were unfamiliar because it was their first time with embedded, and the process of handling the equipment did not go as planned. In addition, since I had to use school equipment, time distribution was very important because it could only be developed when the lab was open from 6 to 9 p.m. every evening. I started to give up one by one for difficult and awkward tasks, and I was unable to read them all. Eventually, the project had to be carried out alone, and although it was completed, the level was low, so I received a mid- to low-level score. There are limitations to what you do alone. If I join Hansol Group, I will cherish my colleagues and create a greater synergy effect by always cooperating with them."""" ""You may think that the job as a developer [a developer contributing to society] is not directly related to customers, but I think this is an old saying."" In the information technology society, what is inseparable in real life is the IT field, and I think this field, which can change society depending on what services are provided and created, is in direct contact with customers and society more than any other field. In that sense, I want to make a great contribution to helping people and making society more convenient. Hansol always tries to find the answer that customers want from the customer's point of view, and tries to get the company and customers close. If I join Hansol, I will be able to achieve my goal, so I applied. [Both open source analysis ability and experience in various projects] I have a lot of experience in programming, so I can handle any task quickly and efficiently. Also, there are many things to study and modify open sources when I enter a company, so the ability to understand open sources is a very important requirement for developers, and since I have them, I can contribute to the company. *Academy*, an Android curriculum, successfully developed an application called 000 000, and during the development process, we practiced a lot to study and modify open sources. For the first time at the time of development, we collaborated with designers and planners who are people from other fields, and it was a beneficial time to learn how to analyze applications from various perspectives as well as from the perspective of developers. 000 is an application that shows weather, traffic, D-Day, and memo information at a glance on a busy morning, and it has now over 2,500 downloads on **** and has become the best application in the fourth week of January. It has also been featured in articles on Money Today and Daily Sports. In addition, we have developed casino games, employee management programs, volunteer programs, shopping cart applications, customized date course recommendations, and return scanners.""[Customized date course recommendation application: 00] 00 is an application that combines big data and data mining to analyze user preferences and recommend customized date courses.When I search for attractions in the area for a date, it is difficult to determine whether they are authentic or not because most of them are advertising texts, and when I look at the courses designed by others, I often don't like them, so I often look for them and design them myself. I started with the intention of making it more comfortable and creating a service that designs the course to each other's taste. During the group meeting, I came up with a number of ideas through brainstorming, and I decided to choose the most necessary and novel one, so I selected 00 that I presented the agenda. Since it was a large-scale project, there were many development issues and it was more difficult to coordinate opinions compared to other projects, but I did not have a big problem because I actively stepped forward and helped them if there was a group who needed help along with a caring attitude. In addition, there were technical difficulties in the development process and problems that occurred because the ideas were not embodied, and the group members held meetings from time to time to discuss ideas and came up with the next best idea. After these efforts, I was able to complete the development safely, and I was able to win an idea award at the LINC Project Group Awards hosted by the university. Also, I always wonder if there is a way to make my work more efficient. Even when I was working part-time, I changed the location of existing items to make the movement easier. Once the location of the item has been determined, people get used to it and don't think about changing it easily. After I changed it, everyone I worked with liked it, saying it was convenient. When it's time for a meeting, I'm active in coming up with ideas without being embarrassed. There are many good opinions after refining and revising opinions that I think are somewhat absurd. When I join Hansol Group, I will try to create new and valuable services."""" [Coding Mania] I'm so excited that I can't tell the time goes by when I'm working on programming, and I'm also talented in this field. It's not that I did well from the beginning. The languages I first encountered when I was a freshman were unfamiliar and difficult, so I tried again two or three times in class and often asked questions to professors. Nevertheless, I was frustrated because my test score was not good, but I didn't feel that I lost interest or didn't want to do it. Then, as I gradually improved, I fell in love with coding, and it became fun, so I actively participated in team projects, and when I got a coding assignment, I was itching to do it quickly. As a result, I often hear that my friends come and ask me questions, and during the project, I become a development leader, and I have a talent for programming. As I gradually felt that there was a difference in skills with my colleagues, I was motivated to improve further in this field. As I worked hard, I received 4.5, received first place in database, computer advanced structure, software analysis design, grades, and team projects. As an intern, I also received first place in a team project. I also applied for an Android expert course run by T Academy to develop an application because I wanted to have a lot of experience in programming, and I challenged the development work as an intern. Now, I want to move away from the undergraduate level and develop something that can be used in practice and contribute socially. There will inevitably be a qualitative difference between what you just do and what you enjoy doing. Even if I join Hansol Group, I will work happily and make it different from other services both quantitatively and qualitatively."",,"
"I completed a comprehensive design project and worked on a project called OpenCopter with my undergraduate students. OpenCopter is a combination of open source and quadcopter, and we started with the goal of lowering the unit price of expensive quadcopter by creating and distributing code ourselves for free. It was a short-term project, so we could have created applications or made simple programs, but our team was greedy and decided to create a quadcopter that recognizes and tracks people. It was impossible to complete the project within the period of time while working on it at the same time as my studies, but I decided to do it as much as possible by dividing it into floating a quadcopter, making an application remote control, and using a camera to recognize and track people. I was in charge of the tracking part. After receiving the video from the camera, it was subjected to a Gaussian Filter process to remove noise, and the specific color was binarized into white and all other colors were binarized into black. Thus, the direction of movement was determined by calculating the distance and angle between the center point of the white area and the center point of the video. And we created an algorithm that determines the area of the white area and the forward and backwardness by the area size. We were able to complete the project and participate in the exhibition thanks to the division of labor in pairs. However, it was regrettable that there were many shortcomings when the algorithm was produced using simple binarization processing due to the lack of time. Since it only tracks specific colors, it fell without recognizing when the person was behind the object. Moreover, since the forward and backward movement was determined based on the area alone, the range of the white area narrowed when the person looked straight ahead and turned to the side, recognizing that the object was far away, and there was a risk of collision with the object due to the quadcopter moving forward. After the exhibition was over, we tried to improve the problems by bringing an opencopter, but there was a limit to dealing with all exceptions at our level. Inevitably, we went to an Internet cafe and completed it with the advice and source of experts. I could have participated in the exhibition as a simple project, but I could learn more because I set a high goal and tried hard.""********** I volunteered at a local children's center for two years. As the chairman of the volunteer group, I organized weekly meetings and helped communicate between the center and the volunteers. After a long period of time, I learned about the internal situation of the center. Since the center is operated only with regular donations, there was a limited number of people who could take care of it. The head of the center was always saddened by the fact that many children wanted to enter the center but could no longer accept the offer, and I decided to find a way to increase the donation. Back then, leaflet distribution was the only way to recruit sponsors. Palm-sized leaflets were small enough to contain the urgency of the center, and they were expensive and inefficient because they could not be distributed in many places. To address this issue, I suggested creating a newspaper called ""The Story of the Persimmon Tree"" instead of leaflets. Newspapers were black and white but easy to see for the elderly in large letters, and they were able to distribute them to a wide area due to the low cost of producing and printing newspapers. Every weekend, I worked hard on newspaper production with volunteers. I drew the cover myself and posted pictures of the children. The newspaper was produced in a total of eight pages, and on the last page, I expressed my gratitude by putting the names of my sponsors. And to show the transparent use of donations, I included the expenditure details. Thanks to the many volunteers' participation in newspaper production, we were able to start distributing the newspaper within two weeks of deciding to produce it. A week later, the volunteers' earnestness was conveyed, and three or four calls a day began to come in asking for sponsorship. Thanks to the new sponsors, I was able to receive children who had delayed admission to the center. Since then, ""The Story of the Gamnamugol"" has been published regularly and has been a great help in recruiting many sponsors. ""When I was a student, I was shy, so I couldn't open my heart first. While going to high school, I joined a theater club to improve my shortcomings. I was immersed in the club slogan, ""When we are apart, it is one drop, but when we gather, we become an ocean,"" and prepared for the performance every day. For the first month, my daily routine was to be criticized and scolded by my seniors. The stage fright I usually had did not go away easily, and unlike my initial determination, I found myself getting depressed. I thought that if I couldn't overcome my fear this time, I would easily give up on anything in the future, and from that day on, I took a video of my lines for two to three hours a day, and practiced through the mirror, discovering problems on my own. After two to three weeks of repeated practice, I was told that my skills have improved. After receiving a few compliments, at some point, I found that I enjoyed the play without getting stressed out. For the remaining two months, I participated in the practice more than anyone else. The practice time that I had hoped for the end was changed from ""practice time that would be over"" to ""practice time that would make me feel sad to finish"", and the teamwork with colleagues also increased, and in the latter half of the practice, I changed into a passionate figure, such as voluntarily practicing additional practice with the actors and editing the script. I played my role safely on the day of the performance. Although I was not the first place as an actor, I received reviews from my colleagues that I have improved more than any other 20 actors. The overwhelming feeling of praise and applause from the audience and friends of the day still lingers in my heart, as I was proud of myself for turning what I once wanted to do into the most enjoyable thing. Through this, I was able to realize the greatness of my efforts and discover the potential for my own development."" ""Theatrical during high school was a valuable experience that changed me."" Even after going to university, I joined a club called 'San Sarang' and continued to do theater and mountain climbing activities with attachment. After just finishing my second year of university, I was given a project task related to my major for promotion to the club.It was an opportunity to receive a subsidy of 5 million won when exhibiting the project after carrying out the assignment. I recruited team members to carry out the project, but the fourth grade with extensive project experience was busy preparing for employment, and the first grade was not experienced enough to carry out the project. The operation of the membership fee for the purpose of running the club was not smooth, so I challenged the project with the goal of applying for some 3rd graders, including myself. In line with the club name, the theme was to implement an information application in the mountains nationwide, and we pledged to achieve the best results with our members and responsibility. For us who did not have knowledge of the application, the graduation project-level task was too high a wall. There was a fear among the team members, 'Wouldn't we fail?' and there were small disputes at each meeting. At the suggestion of a classmate as the team leader, he studied the amount he was in charge of in advance, made a prototype, and started a study to teach other team members, and the application was gradually completed as the study continued. Through the efforts and cooperation among the team members, we were able to complete the task within the deadline. Since most of the exhibitions were projects by the 4th graders, our works were relatively insufficient. However, I was able to get a lot of points because I was the result of my first assignment and the absence of a fourth grader. This served as a decisive opportunity to be promoted from an existing theater club to a major club, and it gave me confidence in my major. ""I developed the web at BaxterIP IT team, a law firm based in Sydney, Australia. My first project was to create a responsive web. I had basic knowledge of responsive web but had no experience in implementing it, so I studied by looking at materials and sources after work every day, and I took charge of creating navigation to implement it. The next project started with my proposal. Due to the nature of the company, counseling with customers was frequent, but there were not enough telephone consultants and the number of branches was small, making it difficult to visit the company. I thought that it would be helpful to attract customers if I created a bulletin board by adding a membership registration/login function and consulted on the homepage. The CEO and the supervisor were interested in my idea and focused on implementing the bulletin board for the last week. I used phpmyadmin to encrypt and store the customer's information in a DB, and when I post on the homepage, I implemented a function that is sent by e-mail. Through the intern, I have experienced and learned not only my major knowledge but also work. Although I am still learning it, I have been creating work momentum by demonstrating my supervisor's know-how and my own strengths, such as writing work mail, prioritizing work, and making plans and processing it. Also, my philosophy - 'People come before work.' I realized that the root cause of happiness and stress, big and small, at work is not work, but human relationships. Finally, what you can do today is not to postpone it until tomorrow. Tomorrow is tomorrow's work, and if you have accumulated work, you will always have a busy day, and if this continues, you may get tired. All of these are my own assets obtained through practical work. I majored in computer engineering and took IT-related courses such as data communication and database, and in the process, I laid the foundation by working on various projects. In addition, the excellent grades of data structure and algorithms prove that my analytical and solving skills are excellent. I promise that the knowledge and experience I have will help maintain SK's status."",,,,"
"In this era when what I imagine becomes a reality, I think IT is the biggest value-added industry of the future. As a non-majors, it hasn't been long since I turned to IT, but I think non-majors are a bigger major for me with various experiences and backgrounds. I want to grow into the best developer in your company. My strength is my ability to immerse myself in something. I have a strong sense of improvement, so I have the ability to dig in to the point where I am scared when there is something I want to do well. I am still at the top of my class by taking classes alongside my majors. The downside is that I lack of verbal skills and have narrow human relationships. However, when I have to be active, I am consciously making efforts. As I think communication skills are the most important factor regardless of field, I will try to become an active and communicating IT person in the future."" This course runs from June this year to early January next year, and I am currently taking intensive education from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at an IT educational institution. Currently, I only have the last project left.

This is not easy for a computer major, and I would like to take on the task of developing insights into various industries by using these various experiences."" As a practitioner, I will do my best to improve myself every day to fill in areas that I lack and become an expert. I want to grow into a full stack dev ops. In addition, the IT field will continue to grow and become an increasingly borderless field, so I will become a globally competent developer based on the foreign languages I have studied so far."
"I am a person who can fulfill my responsibilities by finding the responsibility to take the initiative in the work entrusted to me. When I had to decide something from an early age, I made my own decisions, developed responsibility, and tried to do the leading work accordingly. For example, I participated in a Chinese training program hosted by a college and took on the role of the team leader. At the beginning of the training, all of the students participated hard in class, but in the middle of the training, many students became lazy, so they oversleep and did not attend, so they came up with measures to fulfill their role as team leader. I was encouraged to go to class by getting up early every morning, getting ready first, and going to the room where the students lived, waking them up in person. It was hotter and humid summer weather than Korea, so when I walked around, I sweated for no reason that I took a shower, and I was annoyed to see my friends who were not encouraged to go together. However, I have constantly tried to do my part and have led almost all students back to class. As a result, I was able to complete the training well together, and I was able to grow my sense of responsibility by being thanked for the effort I made to my Chinese teachers as well. Based on my strengths, calmness and meticulousness, I will do my job thoroughly. Programming and software management sometimes take more time to shake mentally when a problem arises in the process of debugging that makes it difficult to know the cause of the problem. However, my calmness has been a solution that allows me to take an engineering approach to the problem without panicking when a problem arises, and to find the cause of the problem based on meticulousness. The downside is the indecision caused by listening to many people. When deciding on something, I try to listen to everyone's story to make the best decision for everyone. In the process, both this person and I have a point, so there are moments when it is difficult to make a decision, but I have made the best decision through many conversations with them. When I joined GS Neotech, I will try to find a conclusion that can produce satisfactory results for all stakeholders."" ""The most successful and meaningful thing was to create an application with my team members to participate in the contest. On the last vacation of my studies, I wanted to have a result that summarizes the knowledge I had learned through my major classes and the practical experience I had gained while working at the research institute, so I persuaded my colleagues to form a team with four colleagues, and among them, I took the role of project manager to achieve satisfactory results through cooperation and consideration with my team members. The first reason that was meaningful was that I was able to apply my major knowledge and practical experience that I had gained so far by participating in everything from planning to design, server and client implementation. By participating in government projects in various major classes and research institutes, I was able to adapt to various development environments, enhance my understanding of software development, and create a complete application based on this. At the planning stage, I proposed the theme of social network using beacons, and started the project with the unanimous consent of my team members, and I carried out the design based on my software engineering knowledge. Amazon EC2 cloud services were used to construct the server, and Apache, My-SQL, and PHP were installed on the Linux operating system to create a server development environment. The client directly implemented the chat and review board functions, which were key functions in the project, targeting Android. In this way, I was able to use IT knowledge in many ways by mobilizing my major and practical experience in the development process to the extent that I was told that I had completed the project by all my team members, and I was recognized for the creativity of the idea to the extent that I was judged and asked to patent the method of using the beacon. The second reason is that through communication and consideration with the team members, we have achieved satisfactory results for all team members. Two of the team members assigned a small amount due to their lack of development experience, but I saw them having difficulties in the development process. I participated in the development of the Android client for them and gave consideration to them more than I did. After completing each one, I collected everyone's quantity for integration, but the data types did not match and each had difficulty in progressing due to their different coding styles. However, through a lot of conversations, we coordinated and focused on the parts that did not fit, and realized the confidence in collaboration and the importance of communication required in the process. As a result of this communication and consideration, we won the contest and it was an opportunity to enhance the teamwork and software development skills of all team members.""""I will quickly adapt to work at GS Neotech through my interest in and experience in the cloud through my academic and practical experience."" Working on the project to be submitted to the contest and using AWS EC2 service as an application server, I became interested in various functions of AWS and its future potential. In addition, while working at the Electronic Components Research Institute, I was able to gain interest and practical experience in the cloud by participating in research and development tasks of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning related to virtual desktops and clouds, using a cloud management tool called Cloud Stack, and developing some of them."" In addition, I gained a wide range of knowledge such as programming language, software engineering, network, database, and operating system through my major classes to lay the foundation for adapting to the computerized job. I developed software to participate in a competition with my classmates, and I took on the role of project manager from planning to planning, leading the team in all parts of design, database, server, and client programming, and developed a sense of responsibility and communication with team members. I believe that my experience and interest in cloud services can be of practical help in performing my duties as a member of GS Neotech, and I will grow into a cloud expert with GS Neotech based on this."",,"
"""From 0 to 100,"" I was able to take the web development capability, which had been zero, one step closer to becoming a full-stack developer through the efforts of the past year. First, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA Framework Practical Developer Training Course' to lay the foundation for web development. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing high-quality projects for 300 hours. As a result, I challenged 'OOOOOOOOOOOOO' to make up for my lack of competency, and I had a good opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For 6 months, I learned both the front and back ends using Spring and value.js, and developed web development capabilities. In addition, I learned the Java algorithm and took the initiative in studying algorithms with my team members. Through this, I was able to develop problem-solving skills and gained the ability to share what I learned by conducting code reviews with my friends. I was able to gain practical skills by conducting team projects in the same form as in practice. The location-based travel record platform, which was born after getting the idea from Github's lawn planting, was in charge of developing the backend using JPA in SpringBoot. Since it was my first web project, I was able to experience various challenges and experiences. I was able to acquire new skills such as login using JWT token, photo management using S3, and application of HTTPS, and I was able to solve various problems during development and develop my problem-solving ability. One of them was when I was dealing with JPA, when I mapped different tables to entities, an infinite reference phenomenon occurred. This phenomenon was difficult to find the cause of the problem after the first time, but as a result of not being frustrated and referring to various technology blogs, it was caused by incorrect design. I found that the two entities were mapped in both directions, and that infinite reference occurred because the database and service were not used independently. In order to reduce the degree of coupling, the request and response DTO required for each API were separately created. Although it took a long time to modify, by creating DTO, I was able to select and send only the necessary information and solve the infinite reference phenomenon. Thanks to the spirit of challenge to acquire new skills and persistence to solve problems, I was able to successfully complete the project and receive the excellence award. As we developed the platform, we reused components as much as possible in front development, efficiently configured the UI, and simplified code and file to increase readability. When it comes to backend development, we made efforts to provide stable service by building MSA-structured server on EC2 which separated server by function. In addition, RESTful API was developed with MVC structure for future maintenance, and we improved the convenience of project distribution by automating distribution with Jenkins. In addition, we were able to learn the process of collaborating while working on multiple team projects. Through Git, we were able to learn version management of code, communication between front end and backend through Swagger, share progress with team members through Jira, and learn how to implement Agile-applied project. ""Incentives from Leading Position"" When I was an undergraduate, I worked for two years in the school's industry-academic cooperation team to solve problem with leading attitude and receive incentives. One of my tasks was to copy expenditure/income resolutions, and these documents became close to 1,000 copies a week. A lot of paper and printer toner were wasted, and the work process was not efficient because it was stored on paper. I thought it would be much more efficient to scan and manage these documents, but managing them required the introduction of a new program. Therefore, I suggested the introduction of a new program to the staff, and after discussing the issue with the team leader at a general meeting, my opinion was accepted. As a result, the cost of introducing the program was lower than the cost of purchasing paper, which saved the budget, improved the work process, and increased the efficiency of the work. The team leader also recognized my hard work and sincerity and received an incentive that was unprecedented. Through this experience, I am responsible for my work, do my best, and have an active attitude. With this attitude, I will become a leading new employee who constantly thinks about a better direction in Kakao.""���,,,"
"""Talent who keeps running"" If I were to describe myself in one word, I would consider myself a ""marathon."" This is because, over the past year and a half, I have built up my web development capabilities with two training sessions and three web projects, and I will continue to build up my capabilities. As a graduation project during my undergraduate years, I developed a sign language translator using Java, and I became attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for Java-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. Therefore, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA Framework Practical Developer Training Course' to lay the foundation for web development. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing high-quality projects for 300 hours. As a result, I was able to challenge 'OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO' to make up for my lack of competency, and I had a great opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For six months, I developed my web development capabilities by learning both the front and back ends using Spring and value.js. After receiving the training, we conducted a recipe recommendation project that considers the user's preference by using a travel record platform project based on user location information and big data, and we were able to present outstanding prizes at both project presentations. Through this project, we were able to develop our full stack development capabilities by participating in both the backend and the frontend. When it comes to front-end development, we reused components as much as possible, efficiently configured the UI, and simplified code and file to increase readability. When it comes to back-end development, we built a service with MSA structure that separated servers by function on AWS to build a stable service, developed an efficient RESTful API with MVC structure, and improved the convenience of project distribution by automating distribution with Jenkins. As I have been working hard on one path, I am confident that I am a talented person who will continue to develop and develop from now on.""""3rd Excellence Award""3rd Project""I gained web development capability by experiencing 3 projects in OO""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. We worked on 3 projects to build a cloud-based web using EC2 and built a server mainly in charge of the backend. I will introduce two of them. First, the project called Commitment is a travel history web service that was born with the idea from Github's lawn planting. Taking charge of the backend, we built a DB using Mariadb and produced various RESTful APIs using SpringBoot. First, we needed the user's location permission to record the trip. However, we realized that location permission was only available in the https environment, and we newly learned that https was required to support security and various services. Therefore, we received SSL certificates and distributed them at https, contributing to the smooth progress of the project. In addition, we were able to grow the most by challenging various technologies such as firebase and S3, and we had the ability to learn and apply new things with the mind of developing developers. Second, Recook was a personalized recipe recommendation service that analyzed users' tastes using big data. His role was to implement recipe recommendation API based on content-based filtering using recipe crawling using python and Django. However, due to the large amount of data, there was a problem that it took about 10 seconds to execute the recommended algorithm. Therefore, we divided the table to optimize the query's performance, and we were able to reduce the time from 10 seconds to 3 seconds. Although the time was shortened, it was regrettable that more time would have been saved if semi-normalization was performed or redis was applied to reduce repetitive join in the initial DB design. As such, I have built up the ability to think about the performance of better projects and to create optimal efficiency.""""CS Study"" I think the most lacking competency at the moment is CS knowledge. I have built up some JAVA programming ability and capability in algorithms through continuous algorithm studies for a year, but I felt that I lacked knowledge of really basic CS. Therefore, a study was formed to gain CS basic knowledge, and the study was conducted every day and a topic of the field each other wanted was selected and presented. The presentation materials were organized in the Notion and organized by subject so that the study members could see it easily. There was a huge difference between knowing the acquired knowledge to yourself and explaining it to others. In order to explain to others, I had to understand the deep content, and when a question came in to the study members, I had to study even matters related to the subject to answer it. Therefore, I was able to make the knowledge gained through the presentation more mine. Even after doing the study, I have time to review every day to familiarize myself with the presentation of other team members, and I am trying to understand exactly what I presented. I will continue to do CS studies and build basic competencies for development. ""'Actual Service' I have worked on three web projects, but I think I still lack web development capabilities. This is because I felt that I lacked the ability to respond to problems that occurred when I actually performed the service because I had not conducted the actual service. To cultivate this, we are continuously maintaining the project and preparing to perform the actual service. I have received 32 feedback from 82 users, and I am trying to improve the shortcomings of the project based on the feedback. We also used Redis to align our data to scale out our servers in the future. We will continue to maintain, build practical capabilities, and build problem response capabilities."""
"In the programming language/A0/1st grade, I took the C language class for the first time and proceeded with a project to create a game. It was difficult to create a game, but the sense of accomplishment gained by completing the functions one by one made me interested in programming. Object-oriented language/B0/When I took the class, I didn't fully understand the C language, so I felt unfamiliar with object-oriented language. However, as I developed a sign language translator using Java as a graduation project in the fourth grade, I became attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for a Java-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. It was a class that allowed me to understand the concepts of database/A0/object, relationship, and attribute. Based on the understood concepts, I was able to understand one-to-one, many-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between objects and learn how to draw ERD. In addition, I was able to CRUD DB data using SQL, understand INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and write Query. I was able to learn about the design and implementation methods of various data structures for data structures/B+/array stack queue trees and graphs. It was a class that could have a solid foundation by learning examples of algorithms to see what kind of situations these data structures could be applied to. Algorithm Analysis/A+/ Through the class, I was able to understand algorithmic notation, alignment, search, and graphs. I learned how to select an efficient algorithm to solve problems according to situations using various data structures. I have experience in creating a recipe recommendation platform based on user taste using big data ""Shortening from 10 seconds to 3 seconds"". I was in charge of implementing the function to recommend related recipes using content-based filtering in Django. Using Python, we imported more than 5,000 recipe data through crawling and processed more than 70,000 review data. We succeeded in implementing the function of recommending recipes with similar ingredients using content-based filtering, but a problem occurred. It took about 10 seconds to receive the data, and it was inconvenient to use the service. To determine the cause, we ran the code line by line and conducted the test. As a result, the reason why it took a long time to receive the data was in query. When there were 70,000 review data, it was the main cause of the performance degradation, and when five tables were joined at once, query's performance dropped sharply. Therefore, the review table and the recipe-hashtag-material-material-material name four tables were joined and imported separately, and only the columns were required. The API, which took 10 seconds to receive the data, was reduced to 3 seconds. Although the time was shortened, it was regrettable that if semi-normalization had been performed to reduce repetitive join in the initial DB design, it would have saved a little more time. As a result, the project was successfully completed, and I realized the importance of meticulous design even if it took time. ""Why we need to distinguish between the entity and the DTO,"" I have experience in contributing to the award of excellence at the SSAFY Common Project Competition by developing the backend of the travel platform production project with constant challenge spirit and persistence. I was in charge of the backend based on SpringBoot, and I decided to apply JPA that I had never learned before. Of course, I was used to using MyBatis, but JPA is known to be excellent in performance, productivity, and maintenance, so I tried to learn a new technology by applying JPA. However, I was not familiar with JPA, so there was a problem during development. After mapping different tables to the entity, an error occurred after going around an infinite loop. In addition, in the response, unnecessary data was provided, resulting in an increase in the amount of response data. I belatedly learned that this problem is caused by not generating the entity and the DTO separately. I realized that DTO is a class for View used by Request/Response, and since it needs to be changed frequently, it is appropriate to create it separately. To solve this problem, I created DTO separately and used the BeanUtils.copyProperties method to convert it from entity to DTO. It took a long time to modify everything, but I realized the necessity of DTO and that DTO served as a designer. Thanks to the spirit of challenge to acquire new skills and persistence to solve problems, I was able to successfully complete the project and win the Excellence Award."",,,,"
"As I like the public interest orientation, I am applying for jobs at public corporations and public institutions. When I saw the job advertisement of the Korea Broadcasting Corporation, I remembered the phrase KBS is a broadcasting station in charge of disaster broadcasting that I saw on TV one day. As a broadcasting company in charge of disaster and a government-funded company, I felt the responsibility of the Korea Broadcasting Corporation to set an example for other broadcasting stations was attractive to me. I will be a talented person who supports from behind and builds a computer broadcasting system that attracts attention from around the world. After joining the company, I plan to go to the graduate school of engineering, psychology, and language. I will become an employee who develops KBS with new skills and knowledge as a person who sees the world widely, and enhances the power of information provision given by broadcasting to a developing country. I have a broad spectrum of knowledge encompassing engineering and humanities. I took 91 credits in electronic and information and communication engineering. This is the result of my previous career as a senior and wanting to learn more about SW. I learned digital & analog circuits, semiconductor design, computer structure, hardware design, low-level words (machine language, C language) in the electronics department, and I learned OS, data structure, advanced language (java), network, communication, and digital media in the communications department. When I had time, I worked on projects such as IoT solutions and video processing. I also gained experience in participating in competitions with undergraduate researchers. In addition, I collaborated with other majors and gained various knowledge by participating in graduation works of SW and Machine department for one year each. In addition, I run the server at home for personal information protection and convenience. I faced numerous errors and problems during operation, and I was able to gain a lot of practical experience by solving them. In terms of humanities, I dug into the language analytically through my double major in English literature, and learned the culture that determines the characteristics and changes from the beginning of the language together. I learned Anglo-American culture, English composition, phonology, syntax, pedagogy, special purpose English (ESP), and interpretation. And I am learning Russian because I became interested in Eastern Europe. Communication and cooperation - Even a strong group had the disadvantage of working alone without teamwork and liking the shortcomings of others in my early 20s. While serving as the team leader in the first grade project, the uncooperative team members criticized and acted arbitrarily, and in the end, the other team members and I, who showed the best performance in our class, got the lowest score in the project despite our outstanding capabilities and grades. Through this crushing defeat, I realized that teamwork is as important as competence. There were several failures until I acknowledged that they were not identical to each other and learned that the best results were achieved in a single team based on each other's strengths. Based on this, I supplemented my shortcomings and utilized my strengths. Furthermore, I assisted and led the team in accordance with my position. In particular, when I participated in graduation work in other departments, I recognized and applied for work that team members needed. In addition, whenever I was the team leader, I identified the strengths of my team members and divided tasks, and systematized the progress of program development by fully utilizing my organizational and planned personality. This Old Tony, youtube.com/user/featony I have been very interested in the principles of how things work and applied science and technology. When I was in middle and high school, I aimed to enter the physics department, and I took classes and learned similar engineering as a major. The contents I enjoy were also greatly influenced by this tendency, and I enjoy watching videos related to mechanical engineering that I do not know well. Among them, I have been watching Tony's channel, which mainly deals with metal processing and processing machines, from the beginning. The principles and techniques explained in detail so that even beginners can easily understand them give intellectual stimulation and engineering inspiration, and the occasional Dad joke, also called 'Ajae Gag', gives me pleasure. In addition, sensationality and verbal violence, which are disadvantages of the high proportion of UCCs in the current trend, are rarely present in this Old Tony channel. For this reason, Tony's channel has become the channel I enjoy most, beating other channels (such as VanossGaming). IT technology can be applied to disaster broadcasting in the contents of the 2019 OOOOO Fall Conference. In the event of a disaster, it is not only the automatic caption generation, but the video editing pattern can be programmed or learned to produce the transmitted video. By learning the transmission video for each situation in advance, such as disasters, social disasters, and civil defense incidents, it can be processed appropriately for each situation. Once the video is completed automatically to a certain extent, the person in charge will quickly correct and send it to you, enabling efficient business processing in an urgent situation. This technology can be used not only for disasters but also for producing general programs. It can be an excellent auxiliary tool for video production by removing time criticality elements and adding various options. By analyzing the type of video, channel, and related data, it is possible to shorten the insertion time of related data, music, and effects by recommending them in real time during editing. In addition, voice recognition can identify the contents of the original video and edit it and recommend changing the order. You can increase the accuracy rate by giving feedback on whether to select a recommendation, and if a certain level of accuracy rate is completed, you will be able to advance to a semi-automatic video production system."
"I applied to Samsung SDS because I wanted to create a customized platform by creating an AI-based platform. I think the important thing in the rapidly changing Fourth Industrial Revolution is to provide new advanced services and differentiated solutions that meet the needs of customers. Samsung SDS has increased the convenience of logistics management by developing its own AI-based integrated logistics management platform Cello, and is securing competitiveness by building a platform that provides customized content based on customers by incorporating AI into retail stores. Therefore, I thought that Samsung SDS, which provides optimal IT services and gives convenience to customers, would provide industry-class advanced services in the future. My goal is to build an AI-based platform and provide new customer experiences at these Samsung SDS. Therefore, I built up my AI capabilities by creating a sign language translator using machine learning to achieve this goal. First, the model was learned and the predictive model was provided by incorporating SVM machine learning, and the predictive accuracy was increased by learning several times to reduce the error of the predictive model. Through this process, I gained knowledge and experience in the field of AI, and became more interested in AI. Based on this experience, Samsung SDS will build a platform that incorporates AI to increase customer satisfaction and contribute to the growth of the company. ""Incentive from Leading Position"" After working for two years in the OO Cooperation Team of the school, I have an attitude to actively solve problems. One of my tasks was to copy the spending/income resolution, and these documents became close to 1,000 pages a week. I thought this part was less efficient. The reason was not only the waste of paper, but also the warehouse where documents were stored was small, and if documents were needed, they had to be found in many documents, so I felt that it was not appropriate for the digital age. So I thought that these problems could be solved by scanning and managing the data. Because I saved toner on paper and print, I saved the budget and reduced the effort for employees to find documents. So I suggested to the accounting staff about scanning and managing the data. The employees also felt uncomfortable, so I discussed the issue with the team leader through a meeting, and my opinion came to be accepted. I had to introduce a new program to change the work process, but the cost of introducing the program was much lower, which saved the OO team's budget. In addition, I improved the work process and increased the efficiency of my work. The team leader also recognized my hard work and sincerity, and I was able to receive unprecedented incentives. Through this experience, I have become responsible for my duties, do my best, and have an active attitude. With this attitude, I will become a leading new employee who strives to improve the problem at Samsung SDS. ""From 0 to 100,"" I was able to become a full stack developer through the efforts of the past year. Developing a sign language translator using JAVA made me attracted to object-oriented programming, and while looking for a JAVA-based development methodology, I became interested in web development. Therefore, I participated in the 300-hour 'JAVA OOO practical developer training course' and built the foundation for web development by learning JAVA, ORACLE, SPRING, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, and CSS. Since then, I have been working on a project to build a CAFE POS system based on the MVC structure, and I was able to understand the MVC construction procedure and structure while taking charge of the implementation part of the ordering system function. However, I had difficulty in understanding the web and developing a high-quality project for 300 hours. As a result, I challenged the Samsung Youth SW Academy organized by Samsung Electronics to fill in my lack of competency, and I got a good opportunity to receive a year of web development training. For 6 months, I was trained in the backend using Spring and the front end using Vue.js, and developed my competence as a full stack developer. After receiving the training, I worked on the high-quality real estate platform project and the travel record platform project, and I was able to receive the second prize at the project presentation. With these built-up capabilities, Samsung SDS will develop a platform that is convenient for customers. ""Securing customers through retail tech"" The social issue I am interested in recently is retail tech. Due to the recent COVID-19 incident, the distribution industry is changing to a smart distribution environment at a faster pace as it triggers the untact business. As a result, domestic and foreign advanced distribution companies are taking the lead in introducing technologies based on the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as AI, big data, and robots to build product tracking, customized services based on big data, and unmanned shopping, and so on, so-called retail technology is emerging. Through Nexshop solutions, Samsung SDS is also enhancing the productivity of its sales staff by providing customized marketing and streamlining store business processes. Now that contact is in our lives, I thought that retailers would come to prefer this retail technology, and that customers would also expect to gain more and more new customer experiences. Therefore, I thought about how to attract customers through retail technology. First of all, when I thought of the inconveniences when purchasing a product, the customer information I had in each distribution channel was different, and the flow of shopping was cut off. I had to log in separately, and the items I was interested in were also different for each site, so I had to get recommendations for products I didn't want. Therefore, I thought it would be great if there was a platform that allowed me to receive product information from all distribution channels, enable payment, delivery, and even product recommendations. Of course, producing such a platform requires a lot of data, so I think it will be necessary to cooperate with other companies first.However, I believed that providing a seamless shopping experience between distribution channels would make it easier for consumers to shop and enable customers to continue purchasing through their platforms. I believe it is time to create a customer-centric business environment rather than an era in which businesses unilaterally provide information to customers."
"I think IBK System is a company that is always striving to respond to changing technologies centered on customers. I applied because I thought that this customer-centered tendency and my tendency to improve and strive without being complacent with reality fit well. During my internship for about 4 months, I have experienced that the part that I thought about and developed from a customer's perspective worked successfully. The company where I interned was a chatbot-type artificial intelligence service development company, and it was a company that used Java and Node.js. Executives were asked to develop a chatbot that could be shown there when they had to go on a business trip to the fair. At first, since it was based on an interactive format, it was made without any image insertion, but it was suggested to first-time users that guidelines might be needed, and I added images and categories so that users could click on the information they were curious about. It was a small part, but this part worked positively for users, and it was an opportunity to let them know about the company once more at the fair. I am also trying to improve myself by applying for an internship and having a project experience for about six months through an educational program, and I applied because I want to become a talented person who can contribute to the IBK system by using my abilities. The value of my personal life is ""Let's be helpful in every position."" I memorized and wanted to make sure that I understood what I learned in my class when I was in school. So, while studying with my classmates, I studied by becoming a teacher and explaining to each other again, grasping what was lacking and filling in the gaps. I wanted to make them understand more easily than I was a teacher, so I thought more and worked hard to find my own explanation method. In the process, my friends said that I explained in a more understandable way than you, and one of my friends said that my math grades especially improved thanks to me. At first, I started to fill in my individual shortcomings, but I gradually became proud to be a person who was helpful to someone. And there was something that I learned about new parts while being helpful to someone. Since then, my abilities have been used to form values to become a person who can contribute and help in any organization. These values have always made me a person who strives to improve my abilities because I don't want to be a person who can't solve a question or help me when someone asks me. I once had a colleague who was very busy in my work life. I was so busy that I helped him with his work for about a month. While helping, there was a column that was dynamically drawn at the front end, and there was a problem with the data not fitting well. Before that, I was trying to implement it by myself by processing and throwing data at the white end, not at the front end, but at the white end, that problem just happened, and I told you how I studied. So I have experience in which my method was used and solved. No one knows how to help me, but I was proud that my method was used and helped. In the training program of the recruitment-linked Java Full Stack course conducted by the company for six months, one of the team members knew that he was outstanding and ignored the opinions of other team members in the progress of the project based on react and java, so I had a difficult experience during the project. This educational program was developed by four people choosing a theme for the remaining three months after conducting both theoretical and practical training at the same time. During the full-fledged development, one team member was very confident in his development skills and had a tendency to ignore others. In particular, I made a lot of remarks that ignored me, taking the fact that I was the youngest as a weakness, and the project proceeded in a way that the team member decided on all of our work. Other team members tried to passively follow me with the idea of ""Because I'm good,"" and I thought the situation was very unfair. At that time, I had to set the path of the page passing from the front, but I was doing it as a react, and it was not easy to deal with the router because it was my first time using it, and it was difficult to contain parameters, and the difference between using the router in the main and sub parts was difficult. The team member was also having a hard time, and he said he would do it within a week, but he said he would do it, and I bought and read a book called ""Technology to deal with react"", searched for how to use the router, made examples into a project, and studied them, and incorporated them into the project to set a path framework. The team member was excellent, but he lacked sincerity, and in the end, I was able to set the framework first and accelerate our project schedule. The team member acknowledged my sincerity and effort and was sorry, and after that, I was able to proceed with the project by accepting the opinions of other team members. I was able to learn that skills are important, but that much sincerity and effort can catch up with them. I was told by the professor that my programming skills were very poor, so I was not good enough. After hearing that, I tried to improve my skills, and I had an experience that I was told that I had worked hard and changed a lot in the next professor's class. In my second year at university, the professor in the business science class asked me to implement the clustering algorithm myself and prepare a presentation for anyone who wanted to present the code. At that time, I was taking another liberal arts class, a programming class, thinking about how to solve the problem, and the joy when the expected value came out when the expected value did not come out, and I was having pure fun in the process of debugging the problem where it was even if the expected value did not come out.As a result of the class, I became interested in programming and had fun, and I decided to do the presentation. Since I had only studied the basic C language, I felt that I was very lacking in implementing logic, and in the end, I was criticized by the professor that it was a very poor presentation and that I think I was not good at it. So, I joined the programming club in our department to improve my skills. The club was an academic club in which they decided on one or two questions in consideration of the difficulty level at programmers sites using the JAVA language, and the next time they met, they shared and reviewed the solutions. At first, I tried to make it my own way by listening to other people's solving methods, and gradually improved my skills by holding on to the problem three times a week, two hours a week. After that, in my fourth year of university, I took an algorithm class by the same professor. The class was also a presentation-type class, so I showed my improved skills by implementing and presenting a new algorithm, and the professor said that my skills seem to have improved more than before, and I got good grades. As an IT technology that will lead the change in finance, I think it is 'AI'. Due to COVID-19, non-face-to-face financial transactions are spreading, and a new type of bank called the non-face-to-face digital banking service Neobank is currently emerging. In addition, big tech companies, which are IT giants that have begun to provide financial services in the era of digital transformation, are emerging. This poses a threat to existing banks as it may lose young customers in their 20s and 30s who are familiar with the new technology. So, existing banks have to make an effort to provide differentiated services, and I think one of these differentiated services is AI. There are a total of four positive impacts that the introduction of AI will have on financial services. First, through work automation, cost can be reduced and efficiency can be improved. Second, customized services are possible by identifying customer needs. Third, products and services can be provided anytime, anywhere according to customer preferences. Fourth, the introduction of AI can provide convenience to the marginalized elderly. Due to these effects, I think AI is a key IT technology. I was interested in big data when I was in college, so I thought I needed the ability to collect and analyze data in order to acquire these technologies. So, when I was in college, I took a data science course and took data analysis methods and data preprocessing using Python. In addition, my internship grew interest in AI while working for about four months at a company that developed a chatbot using Googel Assistant. And in order to increase the development ability amid the rapid increase in the use of web services and mobile due to non-representative financial transactions, the company is currently developing web services based on Spring Boot, along with a six-month Java Full Stack curriculum, so we are trying to equip ourselves with technology in line with the era of digital transformation."
"I had the experience of taking an English presentation class when I was in fourth grade. I hated the personality of not being able to speak well in front of people, so I took the class to practice English presentations in front of people before going out into society. I messed up the first presentation because I was nervous. After class was over, the professor said that I was originally more nervous than I was, and that practice was the only way to live. I started practicing in front of the mirror as I learned from the professor, and I was speechless imagining myself standing in front of people, but I kept practicing until the tension subsided. As a result of practicing several times, I was able to successfully complete the final presentation, and the evaluation table the professor gave me with a smile marked perfect score for all items. Like this experience of overcoming shortcomings, I have been putting top priority on a growing life and am aiming for the following life. The first is a life of harmony with people. Just as meeting the professor led me in a better direction, I believe that because of the people around me, I was able to grow in a good direction and that the present me exists. The second is a life of challenge. In order to grow up, I need opportunities such as 'presentation classes', so I have tried to use them as a stepping stone to make a leap forward by challenging various internal and external activities. I have a habit of not only being meticulous in my work and assignments, but also keeping everything on record. As an intern, the habit of taking notes was really helpful. By keeping records of the priorities of the job and why I had to do it, I was able to see clearly. However, meticulousness sometimes served as a drawback. Considering the position of the viewer, I tried to make the font, line spacing, and visual parts as well as possible, so I spent a lot of time submitting them. However, my senior official complimented me for writing the report neatly and in a viewer's perspective. I think these shortcomings can be overcome by adapting to work. ""Diverse experiences that began as an infrastructure engineer intern"" I had working at an IT infrastructure company. This was because while I was an intern, I was able to experience many things that I could not learn at school, academy, or on the Internet and learn them while working on projects. While managing the entire division's infrastructure as a military computer soldier, I tried to become an infrastructure engineer according to my aptitude, and as a result, I interned at 00, an infrastructure construction company. During my internship training, I took Linux & Aix, VMware, X_86, and storage training, and participated in practical training and projects. I visited various customer IDC and worked on rack installation, server mount and OS setting, RAID configuration, and redundancy tests, and the most impressive work was the installation experience of a total of 35 Dell servers in their IDC. During the initial installation stage, I learned the rack and HW structure. During the OS setting stage, I installed Linux and VMware vsphere and applied it directly to real servers rather than PCs, learned the practical sense, and also saw the SAN structure between servers, network equipment, and storage. Finally, during the redundancy test, I was able to check that the tasks I had done so far were actually well configured for redundancy. Also, during my internship, I was curious about how the cloud served in an on-premises environment is actually used, so I made 3tire, the basic structure of the web, while studying AWS. In the DMZ section, an ELB load-level and autoscaling group were set up to consider the increase in traffic, and a web server was set up with nginx. In addition, LB was set as an internal network so that the WAS area could not be accessed from outside. In order to access the WAS area, proxy_pass was set in the nginx of the DMZ zone to communicate with the internal LB. With just a click, I could feel the power of the cloud by watching the mail service according to complex settings and situations. Through the internship experience, I was able to learn the large composition of the infrastructure and even experience cloud construction. ""Ways for efficient team work in good faith competition."" The final project of the OOO program was a time to think about various problems and solutions. Organized by OOO, the 'Public OOO Youth Internship' program selects a total of 120 people and gives only 1 million interns in order of grades. For this reason, competition in good faith among the selected students was important, and the most important thing was to harmonize the team in the final project with the highest percentage of grades. All of the ""Selection of Clear Purpose"" wanted to become an intern at a public institution that wanted to go with high grades, so everyone was full of motivation. In this situation, it was important for all team members to coordinate their differences, recognize the direction and goal of the subject, and start. Due to the tight time, we proceeded by setting only the direction rather than the exact subject, and the more we proceeded, the more confused the purpose of the project was, and the more we thought differently. As repeated meetings continued, I suggested expressing our thoughts using a whiteboard. Previously, it seemed like catching a floating cloud because I only explained it in words, but by using a whiteboard, I was able to get my purpose right. I also learned the importance of sharing the work progress of team members. Each day was important because I had to finish the project in a short time. That's why I had to spend the day efficiently, and for this, it was important for everyone to recognize what each team member was doing and why. This is because team members can tell me whether the direction was right or wrong. So every day, I had a short time to share what to do today, what to do tomorrow, and what wasn't going well, within 15 minutes. By communicating only the key elements briefly every day, our group was able to proceed efficiently in a short period of time. ""Creative challenging spirit"" When I overcame my own shortcomings, I also studied fields such as infrastructure, cloud, and big data, not just development students when I graduated from school. I always lived a life of ""creatively challenging.""I think this is similar to Webzen's vision and the reason for its success. In the past, Webzen found a new breakthrough overseas by transferring part of its game IP, such as graphics, trademark, character, and distribution, beyond the way it used to earn royalties by selling publishing rights. I wanted to be with Webzen as I watched them succeed by seeking domestic and international expansion in various ways without being complacent about the way others did and always did. While preparing for the application this time, I found that it created a software education classroom for local youth, operated coding and software education programs, and provided young people with opportunities to experience various software activities. In the past, I was able to grow by receiving free 100 hours of Java education at school and free education in the field of data analysis at the Korea Data Promotion Agency. I want to contribute my abilities to society by sharing the benefits I received in the past with Webzen. Webzen is Korea's leading game company and offers a variety of games. Although there are still shortcomings, I will lead a large-scale infrastructure stably and successfully based on the experience of computer diseases and the experience of the cloud I learned while interning."
"""Aiming to the Experts of Vision AI"" Lotte Information and Communication is striving to improve customer satisfaction and the company by researching AI and applying it to various domains in line with the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We supported Lotte Information and Communication by seeing the infinite growth potential of the company, which is becoming a leading company of DT based on its outstanding technological prowess. Vision AI technology using deep learning and computer vision is a field of excellent application that can provide various services to products. When I was an undergraduate, I was interested in Vision AI when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which transcends the recognition rate of human sight. In the future IT era, which is more advanced than the present, I want to be a person who leads innovative social values through independent implementation, not just using these technologies. During my studies, I gained my skills mainly through industry-academic research and competition projects using computer vision algorithms such as object detection/recognition/tracking. Even during the period when there was no industry-academic research, I learned practical knowledge by working as a freelance developer at a company that was introduced by the professor for constant self-development. Thanks to various experiences, I have developed the ability to logically approach the attitude of project collaboration and image processing issues and implement the platform through basic technology. Based on my accumulated capabilities, I always want to pay attention to the latest Vision AI technology, cope with the rapidly changing environment, and find issues that need improvement to contribute to performance improvement and optimization. I will become an expert who leads the design and implementation of Vision AI's solutions by becoming the subject of the development flow. ""AI modeling competency"" I think the ability to create high-performance AI models is the most important in the Vision AI job. I developed my AI modeling ability by participating in a competition to compete for model ranking on a real-time ranking board. I set a goal of winning the top three prize in the competition and challenged the image classification category. In the preliminary round, I barely advanced to the finals with a low-ranking performance due to a mistake in misdirection of model design and implementation. However, I didn't give up and took the last mistake as an opportunity to continue the challenge. In the finals, we found the issue that the given dataset was perfect through thorough analysis and designed it to solve it. By applying oversampling to model learning, the data imbalance was alleviated and the generalization of noise data was suppressed by applying Label Smoothing loss. Since then, we have built a completely refined dataset by using self-training to Pseudo labeling noise data. As an additional performance improvement strategy, we found and applied an augmentation method suitable for the dataset and created an Ensemble model that has undergone various hyperparameter tuning. We won second place in the competition by creating a model that improved the first baseline F1-score from 0.46 to 0.87. We have acquired several technical capabilities for improving AI modeling performance and gained confidence in development. Even when performing our duties, we are confident in implementing solutions that quickly find and solve image recognition development issues and produce optimal performance. ""Efforts for active sociality"" We had a weakness of the lack of sociality due to our introverted personality. We felt the need for change because we thought that insufficient sociality was the worst attitude as a developer who grows through collaboration and sharing information. I engaged in a total of three activities and tried to become a person with active social skills. First, I participated in as many practical assistance activities as possible, and conducted Q&A and troubleshooting about the code. I was able to increase my network by talking to many people, and I developed my conversation ability to communicate knowledge efficiently to listeners. Second, I participated in several contests and developed my ability to collaborate with my team members. Even if there were problems in other work parts, I communicated together, found the cause, helped each other, and cooperated organically. I was able to gain confidence in collaboration by succeeding in the project based on teamwork. Finally, when development was completed, I always wrote a thesis based on the implementation and presented it at an academic conference. It was a good time to think about other approaches to implementation or ways to improve performance by exchanging opinions with the audience on the contents of the presentation. Based on the knowledge I shared with many people, I was able to grow one step further by grasping the latest research trends. As a result of consistently practicing the three activities, I felt that I was growing as a developer by actively communicating with people. We will continue to actively respond to new technologies and maintain active social skills so that we can become AI developers who grow with our teams. ""Challenging spirit to overcome difficulties"" When I was a 4th grader, I carried out a team project aimed at winning the nation's largest ICT contest. It was a difficult goal because about 430 teams participated and only 16 teams won the main prize, but I challenged with the will to do anything. Prior to the submission of the contest, I first received an interim evaluation as an on-campus capstone design project. Contrary to expectations, the project did not produce any clear results and received the worst score of being the last place on campus. I was frustrated with the thought that the project I had been preparing had failed, and I was afraid that I would not be able to meet the graduation conditions, let alone link to the contest. In particular, I felt more distressed because I felt responsible for not being able to lead the project properly as a team leader. However, when I came in last anyway, I felt that I had no reason to fear failure anymore, and I decided to use this failure as an opportunity to recover from my mistakes. With the determination to risk everything, I focused on development by reducing sleep time. The project direction was partially changed, and the technologies required for implementation were collected and implemented in stages. When I needed more professional opinions, I listened to various professors and working-level officials to find improvements. As the saying goes, ""Efforts do not betray,"" I won the main prize that I aimed for, ranking 7th out of 430 teams in the competition, and I received a silver prize at an academic conference for my thesis based on the implementation.It was the best experience for me to achieve my goals by relentlessly challenging and not giving up on failures. ""Holding skills and utilization"" Python ? 5, Java ? 4, Android-3, Tensorflow ? 5, Pytorch ?4, Caffe-3, Linux ? 4 ""Lightening for optimum performance and processing speed."" Lightening is the technology field that I'm most interested in right now. In the embedded software-based project during my master's degree, limited computing power or memory and power have always been a problem. To solve this problem, we compared and studied lightweight deep learning algorithms with algorithmic lightweight technology, and sought a system that uses technology with appropriate performance to perform high performance and fast inference with little memory. It is regrettable that we couldn't do more research because we came across lightweight technologies near the master's degree. We also want to study optimization for trade-off, which reduces performance as we pursue higher lightweighting steps. Considering the future trend of increasing the use of IoT and mobile devices, it is expected that the provision of services using deep learning technology will gradually expand in small devices. Therefore, I think light weight is a technology that must be accompanied in order to provide deep learning services even in environments with limited resources. If I join the company, I would like to work on research and development with light weight so that I can provide optimized services in various environments as well as develop deep learning solutions for providing services."
"""Implementing the core technologies of domain-specific mobile objects"" Hyundai AutoEver AI job is developing mobility technologies not only for automobiles but also for domain-specific mobile objects such as drones and AGVs. In particular, it is focusing on the implementation of image recognition-based positioning technology and situation understanding technology to construct autonomous driving algorithms for domain-specific mobile objects. In the case of automobiles or indoor mobile robots driving in tunnels, GPS use is limited, making it difficult to locate them in real time. In order to solve this problem, Visual Localization/Odometry, which is a positioning and mapping technology using feature points of an image, and Object Recognition/Tracking technology for context understanding are essential. Domain-specific mobile objects are implemented based on embedded systems that are gradually becoming ultra-small. As they become smaller, relatively scarce resources must be used efficiently, so optimization must be accompanied based on the overall understanding of embedded systems. Therefore, it is judged that offloading technology for the use of minimal networks and deep compression technology to reduce the burden of using deep learning models in low-power devices are additionally needed. I believe that video comprehension technology, which is applicable to the overall domain-specific mobile object, embodies the core of mobility automation and has infinite potential for development that can bring about a new paradigm of the Fourth Industrial Revolution by combining it with other advanced technologies. ""Creativity in Thinking of Efficient Methods"" As a strength, I have the creativity to constantly think about issues that need to be improved and to come up with effective methods. I have experience in increasing development efficiency by using my creativity when participating in projects of external companies as freelancers while studying for my master's degree. We have developed a deep learning-based real-time license plate recognition project that can respond to external matters such as changes in the brightness of the place or illumination. It was discussed that the learning data should be based on the image of a license plate taken directly on the road during the project order phase, but I thought that the method was inefficient. To improve this, we proposed and approved a crawler implementation that automatically extracts images searched on the web. This has made it possible to secure data without having to go outside. However, the crawler method also found the disadvantage of manually extracting the license plate text data in the acquired image and felt the need to improve it further. For a more efficient way, I have come up with a way to use the license plate recognition system in implementation for data collection purposes. We have implemented a system that recognizes the license plate number passing by from the RTSP image of the road CCTV and uses the classified license plate text as learning image data through the segmentation process. Automating to efficiently collect learning data allowed us to focus on implementing key algorithms and successfully terminate the project on the completion date. We will contribute to the development of artificial intelligence with our creativity to constantly think about problems and improve the efficiency of projects. During my studies, I have carried out various projects by utilizing Object Localization/Recognition/Tracking to acquire expertise in deep learning and computer vision technology. When I was an undergraduate of ""Aggravated Reality RC Car Using Raspberry Pi"", I developed an RC car of VR augmented reality game contents that sets driving records on model roads by linking Capstone design and OOO ICT competitions. We implemented computer vision rule-based Object Localization/Recognition and other backend algorithms on embedded hardware that recognize signs, traffic lights, driving lanes, etc. on the road. It became an opportunity to faithfully learn the basic knowledge of traditional computer vision. In a contest in which more than 430 teams participated, they entered the top 10 and received a bronze award, and they published a paper at an academic conference and received a silver award. ""Autoprogramming for Web Applications"" With the support of OOOOOO, we researched technologies related to intelligent automatic programming and developed an automatic creation platform for web applications based on sketch images. We implemented an algorithm that detects the layout of sketch images and web objects by using computer vision and deep learning-based Object Localization/Recognition and automatically generates HTML codes that match classified results. It was a good experience to proactively develop the overall deep learning platform backend, which was in charge of designing deep learning networks to collecting and preprocessing learning data. It succeeded in TTA certification and patent registration with the content of automatically generating code using computer vision-based heuristic method and deep learning image recognition, and published a KCI paper after receiving the Best Paper Award at an academic conference. ""Porting Vehicle License Plate Recognition Algorithm on SoC Board"" He worked as a freelance developer at Truen, a video device manufacturer, and developed a license plate OCR system. Regarding the text recognition of vehicle license plate, we focused on the internalization of technology that can be operated on lightweight embedded boards and can respond to external matters of real-time recognition. Object recognition/Tracking was implemented for OCR for license plate text in real-time video. Lightweight deep learning algorithms with few computations and efficient structure were used for the use of low-power embedded boards. The pre-stage development was successfully completed and the contract was extended to industry-academic research within the school for maintenance. Based on the implementation, he published it as a KCI paper. I was interested in artificial intelligence when I heard the news of the emergence of ResNet, which showed a 96.4% recognition rate exceeding the 94.9% recognition rate of human vision when I was an undergraduate ""to become the subject of the development flow."" In particular, image-based artificial intelligence using deep learning and computer vision is a key field that combines mobility to create synergy and become a leading technology for autonomous driving. I want to be the subject of the development flow that provides innovative mobility services and solution design to both customers and companies by utilizing image-based artificial intelligence.Through this, when the advanced future IT era arrives, I will not simply be a user who receives services, but a person who leads social values through independent implementation. As part of my efforts to become the subject of the development flow, I have steadily conducted industry-academic research and contests, and through communication with the team, I have developed an attitude of collaboration to coordinate opinions and improve projects in a better direction. In addition, I have developed my expertise by actively utilizing and developing the knowledge I understand after reading and developing artificial intelligence and embedded papers necessary for my job, as well as writing papers based on the implementation contents. Thanks to my experience in various projects, I have developed the ability to logically approach AI development issues and implement platforms through underlying technologies. Even after joining the company, I will become the subject of the development flow and become an expert who leads the mobility service using artificial intelligence-based video understanding that will be commercialized in the future."
"The biggest reason for applying to Woori Bank is that it is a company that actively promotes digital innovation by conducting digital transformation. With the advent of the era of untact due to COVID-19, the bank's business is changing more rapidly, centering on fintech. Woori Bank is preparing to follow this trend by hiring 100% of the digital fields. In particular, big data in the financial industry has a large amount of data on hand and is growing rapidly. This will soon be an opportunity to increase my analysis capabilities and grow like Woori Bank by providing various analysis opportunities. One of the reasons for choosing Woori Bank is to deploy them as a digital group and then dispatch them to the business site. Most banks were dispatched to the business site immediately, and it seemed that they would be wondering what to do to maintain their analysis capabilities. However, Woori Bank will be able to prepare related capabilities in advance according to where they are deployed. After joining Woori Bank, I want to become an expert in developing a recommendation system or natural language processing. I want to develop a service that customers can immediately feel by developing a recommendation system for financial products. Or, I want to contribute to classifying users' transaction details or improving AI counseling services through natural language processing. Curiosity The 'digital DNA' I have is curiosity. Curiosity is the driving force behind finding an analysis problem. With this curiosity, I analyzed the data for the 2021 secondary school teacher general society appointment test. My friend thought about OOO as a support area for the appointment test. This is because the number of OOOs recruited is large, and I thought the cut line would be lowered. I wanted to check these expectations with data. A total of 8 regions were analyzed, and 6 years of data were used for each variable. There were not many variables, so a scatterplot was drawn to understand the relationship between each variable. When looking at the scatterplot, it was determined that there was a pattern between the number of applicants and cut lines by region, so we analyzed it by region. Of course, there was a limitation that there were not many samples by region, and not all regions were analyzed. However, it was a good experience to solve the problem of predicting test cut lines found out of curiosity through analysis. ""Capability to convert and solve data problems"" Even if you find an analysis problem with digital DNA called curiosity, it is meaningless if you do not have the ability to convert and solve data problems. In OO, we developed this capability by conducting an analysis project under the theme of proposing the location of additional rental stations for public bicycles. The key to the project was, 'How can we solve the proposed location of additional rental stations with data problems?' So what I came up with was to create a model that predicts the monthly capacity of a specific point based on the location of the facility and weather data. A total of 8 variables were selected as a forward selection method for linear regression analysis and a prediction model was created. The loan volume was predicted by applying this to the candidate group selected based on population density. In addition, we visualized the traffic marginalized areas by the number of additional bus operations and proposed six more rental stations at random. The roles I played in the above process were mainly data collection and pre-processing. In particular, I was proud to convert the location information of the facility into the number of existing near a specific point in the pre-processing. In addition, it was interesting to reduce the selected candidate group to K-means clustering for the efficiency of prediction. While working at our bank, I will find the analysis problem out of curiosity, which is my digital DNA. And I will contribute to solving the problem by converting it into a data problem. ""Improvement of withdrawal report service: classification of usage history"" I want to improve the deposit and withdrawal report service of Woori WON Banking. In the analysis of major expenditures, I would like to classify and provide more detailed information about customers' card payments. For example, how much food is spent per month, how much is spent on transportation, etc. are classified and provided. In particular, with the revitalization of the subscription economy these days, subscription services are consuming a considerable amount of money. Therefore, if you classify and present the amount you spend on subscription services, you will be able to effectively help manage customer assets in terms of consumption. To provide these services, you need data in which usage history is accurately classified. You will be able to use the One-Touch Notification app to obtain this training data. Instead of providing a simple memo function like now, it provides a function that allows users to label predetermined categories. And first of all, the One-Touch Notification app should provide a dashboard so that customers can actively classify usage details. If you continue this service until sufficient data is accumulated, you will be able to obtain high-quality training data. Finally, if you create a classification model with the acquired training data through natural language processing, you will be able to provide a customer's card payment usage history classification service."
"I applied to Shinsegae I&C because I can contribute to ITO and ITS business as a developer of MIS-based AI and SW solutions. Through this, I will be reborn as a leading IT service company and prime IT partner and value creator along with Shinsegae I&C. After understanding the ERP, CRM, and management strategies among the fundamental MISs of the target company, I have built up the capabilities to provide the optimal AI and SW solutions for scientific and intelligentization of customer business by applying the optimal SW architecture and technology. Regarding SW capabilities, based on LG CNS's field SW development processing model, we carried out the web and mobile SW app development team project and built up the capabilities applicable to field SW development. We performed the web full stack part by developing ""OOO"" and ""OOO"" web applications using Node JS, React JS, and DevOps in the OOO SW competition, and won the Excellence Award in the OOO SW competition. In addition, App Dev, IMGUR, and ""MusicMe"" Android mobile applications were developed using JAVA in OOOOOO-linked industry projects and software scholarships. Among them, OOO apps were selected as A grade among OOOOOO Capstone achievements. With regard to management domain and AI capabilities, AI research institute Securayer analyzed actual management big data of global companies such as Walmart and Amazon based on management domain knowledge and is preparing to present MFE and AutoML implementation papers to KCI Society through Meta feature extraction technology research research research for AutoML. Through this, we will implement IT platform and SW solution based on AutoML optimized for customer management big data. What I want to do in the supported SW development group is to provide optimal business SW solution by identifying the deep business needs and MIS core of various customers. This is because the job needs to manage the customer's business big data with ERP and develop applications such as CRM using it and SSG PAY that reflect actual marketing strategies. In this regard, I have experience in differentiated projects such as deriving requirement definitions, data modeling, and design patterns suitable for the consumer's business needs and developing SW apps accordingly. At the OOO SW contest, I produced the first educational support web app that complements the limitations of the official educational platforms 'e-learning center' and 'clasting', which are in the era of non-contact, through a survey of elementary school teachers and received the Excellence Award. The school's Capstone project is developing a web app to meet the growing pet demand due to the non-face-to-face and national economic crisis with a free pet consignment service. The OOO industry project is working on a team project to develop a mobile app that utilizes consumer public data to provide the optimal route for shopping at the lowest cost in the shortest time. As a software scholarship student, I completed a six-month exchange student course at OOO OOO. More than 20 team projects with foreigners by applying the latest technology in various SW fields. The APP_DEV project developed the mobile version app of IMGUR, an image sharing site, as JAVA, and carried out the DevOps project using Docker and Kubernetes. As a Capstone project, we developed a Java-based MUSICME mobile application. We were in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, and heart rate analysis algorithm development for the function of identifying users' mental conditions according to their heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly. We will continue our innovative digital franchise after joining the company through our experience in completing more than 30 domestic and international projects, as well as SW and teamwork capabilities. In the summer of my fourth year, AI research institutes challenged me for an AI engineering internship. Of the seven laggle compositions, three were assigned within 40%, and four were assigned the prediction accuracy calculation within 100%, but we voluntarily challenged the goal of calculating the prediction accuracy within 40% of all seven. We set a goal to derive solutions focusing on complexes that derive solutions by analyzing the DB of global companies by utilizing the management major domain. At first, I thought that the possibility of achieving the goal was close to zero because I had the most insufficient data analysis experience and AI capabilities among interns. In fact, I was frustrated in the beginning because I didn't know how to use basic open sources such as PANADAS and Sikhitron. So to achieve the final goal, we classified the difficulty of the competition from 1 to 7 and selected seven competitions including one each for all difficulties, and established a strategy to achieve systematic competency growth and final goal through step-by-step overachievement. As a result of persistent competence, I achieved the best performance among interns beyond the final goal and received incentives and full-time offers. In addition, by challenging the study of meta feature extraction, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 15 English papers on MFE and AutoML, as well as the process of using existing MFE such as OpenML, Google Cloud AutoML, Sikhitron's AutoML library, and Feature selection algorithm recommendation paper. In the future, we plan to implement our own AutoML library based on MFE and OpenML and present academic conferences such as KCI. Based on this, even after joining Shinsegae I&C, we will challenge and challenge new technologies and learning, build necessary capabilities, and eventually overcome them. In addition, we will improve S Mind's AI customer analysis and ML process based on AutoML implementation capabilities, and build an optimal IT system and platform using customer big data analysis."
"1) This is a problem that I experienced when I developed the backend with Node JS and the front end with React JS in the process of developing the Web full stack in the BE SW contest. I planned the first educational support web application called ""OOO"" through the survey of elementary school education platforms and tools called ""eLearning Center"" and ""Clasting"" through the survey of elementary school teachers in the era of non-contact, and was originally in charge of backend development. It was equipped with an express server using Node JS, and managed members by connecting DB using NoSQL MongoDB. Then, the router for each function was set up using middleware on the express server, and the session was created and made available only when the user logged in. When user data was added to the mongodb by adding members, the password was encrypted and saved using the virtual function. Since then, the entire code has been subdivided into functional modules such as setting, database, route, etc. for ease of operation and management, and the OAUTH method of passport has been used to enable user authentication at log-in, including the FACEBOOK login function. Currently, we are developing real-time group chat room functions using socket.io technology. However, the problem occurred when we temporarily configured and tested the front end using the view engine and the seminal UI and connected the front end part of the team member developed with React to the back end code. I had to complete the front end source code that only the web design was completed and the function to transmit data to the back end using the post was not equipped. So I was able to learn about React JS through YouTube lectures that implement apps using Node JS and React JS. However, React JS is a technology that requires a lot of time to learn due to high learning curves, so it is currently difficult to understand the React JS source code of the team member and put in the necessary parts. I am currently trying to complete it into a complete application. Meanwhile, I was dispatched to OOO, the forerunner of OOO, in France, as a scholar to OOO, where I worked on DevOps projects using Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes for eight weeks and implemented three web applications. I read official documents in English and learned about the concept, function, and implementation of DevOps. I put front-end source codes written in Python and Node JS, data transfer and storage capabilities using Redis and PostgreSQL, and back-end source codes written in Java in each cluster of digital ocean and then tried to learn how to schedule deployments through trafik and cadvisor. And I learned through trial and error how to create yaml files for each role. Eventually, the team succeeded in building and automatic deployment, implementing a voting service web application. And this became an important step in becoming a full-stack engineer through our teamwork and better utilization of DevOps. In addition, we studied meta feature extraction and AutoML, which lack the number of existing research papers because it is a new AI technology in the security layer, and analyzed more than 15 English papers in depth. As a result, we have built up our own AutoML implementation capabilities and will write a paper. We found that meta feature is defined as the characteristics measurements of dataet and is extracted from dataet for the purpose of measuring similarity between dataets. After that, we deeply analyzed the process of existing MFE application methods such as OpenML, Cykitron's AutoML library, and Feature selection algorithm recommendation paper. As a result, using the repository that stores existing databases such as OpenML and solutions for them, Cykitron's AutoML conducted meta-learning on the input dataset, extracted the learning algorithms and parameters used in the most similar dataset group, preprocessed and classified learning, Bayesian optimization, and optimized them with ensemble techniques to derive the optimal AI solution for the input dataset, and FS Algorithm concluded that it recommends the optimal FS model using meta learning. 2) I have experience leading the Capstone Project for 6 months at Android OOO OOO. Based on my initial business plan of identifying users' mental conditions based on heart rate and providing appropriate music accordingly, I gradually embodied the functions and design of the app with my team members. In addition, the team shared the vision that this would reduce users' daily stress and faithfully performed each other's parts for 6 months. I was in charge of Arduino coding, UI development, heart rate analysis algorithm search and development. We developed a basic UI and coded it with JAVA to enable movement between UIs by clicking buttons. And by coding Arduino, hardware and mobile were connected to Bluetooth, and the user's heart rate data was read with a sensor and visualized as a graph. However, the problem was that we could not implement an algorithm to estimate the user's psychological state by analyzing the data received from the sensor. This is because there was no research paper that clearly distinguished the section of the heart rate and distinguished the appropriate human psychology.Therefore, instead of calculating and analyzing the read heart rate data to determine the user's mental state, it was replaced with a function that visualizes it in a graph and shows it. On the other hand, since the psychological state cannot be grasped, the music recommendation function has been replaced so that the user's spotify account and app can be connected to use the spotify's own recommendation function. Overcoming the limitations of the absence of research papers, I completed an initial application called OOOO and was selected as an A-grade project by OOOO in recognition of the novelty of ideas and sincere process performance. I will become an AI backend expert who sympathizes with consumers and develop Naver's search engine and recommendation algorithms to best meet the needs of consumers. Currently, Naver's search and recommendation technology, in combination with AI technology, is focusing on improving keyword exposure, advertisement exposure, product exposure, image search, and translation services that have learned user search patterns. Through image search advancement, keyword challenge, influencer search, Q-brain technology to identify search intentions and provide customized search results, automatically recommend content in the field of interest without users having to search through AiRS technology, and through AiTEMS, technology that finds and recommends products that customers want to find and buy from vast product contents are being developed within Naver. In addition, I will improve the scope of search targets to a search engine that widely recommends not only domestic but also overseas English websites when searching for technical or English content. We will expand our pipeline with users to secure DBs for various search terms, and develop optimal recommender systems by using consumer psychology and marketing insights in business administration domain knowledge, thereby implementing a search algorithm that optimally meets the needs of consumers. Through this, I will become a managing developer that enables Naver to gain a competitive advantage in the competition between Baidu of China, currently the biggest competitor of global IT company Naver, and Google of the U.S. I completed a six-month exchange student course at OOO OOO. Based on a project-oriented curriculum, rather than a theory-oriented one in the computer engineering department of Korea, I had to self-directed learning of the latest SW practical skills in various fields such as security, network communication, games, web apps, mobile apps, and practical math algorithm development to complete more than 20 projects. I had to complete individual or team projects within a limited period of two to three weeks, and due to the difficulty of the curriculum, I often worked on two to three different projects at once. Working on projects for more than 50 hours a week, I felt a lot of pressure and limitations of physical strength every day. However, I was deeply immersed in this process, fascinated by the sense of achievement in learning new technologies and completing them with my colleagues. As a result of intensely carrying out projects in this learning environment and repeating self-reflection at the end of each project, I was trained to develop problem-solving skills, achieve the best practical results in a limited time, and acquire new skills in a short time. Eventually, I was able to complete all major projects with my colleagues at Epitech Paris, and as a developer, I was able to grow significantly in both teamwork and development capabilities."
"The motivation I applied to Woori Bank is that there are many things I can do related to the operation of the network infrastructure that I have studied and researched with interest, and I felt that I would be able to grow a lot. Woori Bank will have a very large network infrastructure in operation, and I think that the importance of stable operation of network infrastructure is more emphasized than any other company due to the nature of the company as a bank. I want to contribute to the stable operation of large network infrastructure that is practically commercialized beyond the laboratory, which is an academic environment. I am researching/developing the flow security control of the cloud cluster using eBPF/XDP to support the job that provides stable service for the network. The development is largely divided into: 1. Monitoring packets with eBPF in the kernel of the virtualized physical machine that makes up the cluster (including packets from the virtual machine) 2. Collecting the corresponding data and making the database of the entities responsible for security (I target DDoS) 4. Research/development of hardware-accelerated XDP-based firewall control system for blocking the corresponding malicious flow was actually done at the edge cloud cluster response testbed K-ONE playground, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology site, and achieved the results of the domestic/international society intervention (the best thesis award of the international society) and external presentation with the domestic/international journal submission (SCI). I was the leader of the demonstration team in the lab. The team members I worked with had different development tasks. Because of this, there were debates while working with each other, and it was difficult to resolve them and have everyone as a team. However, not only did we overcome these as a conversation and complete the demonstration, but we have also maintained a good relationship since then. The idea of the demo in our lab was to send the video from the IoT device to the edge cluster using SDN, and then to AI process the video from the edge cluster and send the result back to the display server. As many people were developing a demo, there were many minor issues, such as misalignment of each other's development directions and rebooting the physical machines that we were working on in collaboration. And the team members were also able to feel each other's emotions burn up and the relationship deteriorated when this happened. So I invited them all to have dinner together and sat down at a table and told them that if they collaborate, of course, they would complain. And I also stressed that since we are all students, anyone can make mistakes, and the next person who makes them may be themselves. And we agreed that if we make a little concession and understand each other, better results will come out. And we started to understand each other more. And that's how we started to understand each other more."
"""OOO - Analyzing Digital Signage Vulnerabilities and Presenting Security Guidelines"" I analyzed the vulnerabilities of digital signage called digital electronic signage in the second phase of OOO's operation from September to December 2019 at OOO, Korea, and I participated in the competition called 'Fiddler, Emulator, Wireshark, FTK manager, uart, and logical analogizer to analyze four platforms, model the threat of STRIDE, and write a paper. I was awarded the Excellence Award by the Korea OOO Association and received the Excellence Award at the Korea OOO Association for writing a paper on the vulnerabilities of the Digital Signage Management Solution and the security threat scenario using IR Relay. In addition, I have experience in reporting vulnerabilities by analyzing products of large domestic companies and receiving letters of appreciation. ""Find OOO Security Frailures Competition hosted by OOO"" I participated in the 'Find OOO Security Frailures' competition, which was held from November 30 to December 1, 2019. The competition was a competition to find vulnerabilities on OOO's homepage and rank them by scoring them based on what was reported. We hacked the web through proxy and JavaScript bypass, and as a result, we won the top prize. I have experience in having concept meetings and making plans every month to improve the quality of the articles of the ""AhnLab University Student Reporters"". It was my first time writing an article, and a lot of preparation was required to increase my professionalism. It may be convenient to write an article in a random way before a concept meeting and planning, but it did not guarantee the quality of the article. In this regard, we wrote about 10 articles by providing feedback and enhancing our expertise through dialogue. ""On-the-job training at the OOO OOO OOO Support Center"" I worked as a field trainee at the OOO OOO OOO Support Center for one month in January 2017, and have experience in writing a summary report on information protection measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (product, service status survey (at home and abroad), Japanese SMEs' information protection measures (at home and abroad), document file and contents summary analysis of the web vulnerability analysis result of small and medium-sized enterprises in OO area in 2016, and practice in writing an information protection education operation plan for employees of SMEs and college students in OO area (curriculum, personnel, period, public relations methods, etc.). In order to complete the assignment in a short period of time, I went to work 30 minutes earlier than others, made search and research a part of my daily life, and wrote it based on writing documents. ""Information Protection Club in my school"" From March 2013 to July 2014, I worked as an information protection club on campus. While working as a club, I have experienced reversing, algorithms, war game solving studies and seminars, and PC management program production projects. ""The bank that develops because of me"" I am an IT student. However, while seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to a related department, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military after receiving several positions in the information protection class. During my military life, I felt the importance of time, and I felt regret that I had quit in the middle. However, up to this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. When I joined the military, I met good executives and learned how not to give up on anything. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit in the squad leader education team that only the aces of each unit came to. Before I went to the military, I always studied various fields only through outward licking education, but after discharge, I think I should do it step by step properly, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. I had the thought of living abroad at least once, and after discharge, I saved money and went to a working holiday. In addition, I started jiu-jitsu that I wanted to do but couldn't start because I was afraid, and I went to a municipal competition and won a silver medal. In addition, I also did my best in my major by working on projects like OOO and OOO, and made good results. When these experiences come together, I think that I can work with persistence every three days, always remind myself of my goals, overcome my shortcomings, and strive with passion to become a member of IBK Industrial Bank, I want to learn work step by step with the attitude of a passionate new employee, approaching first, and becoming a junior who is recognized by the customer, colleagues next to me, and seniors. ""Standards of failure, behavior."" I don't think I act on the standard of failure. There was a cause for me to live and work the way I do now. A friend asked me at a bar with a friend. ""Why do you live?"" The words that I always felt were playful came across as serious and heavy. When I tried to answer them, I couldn't think of an answer. In fact, it was right that I had never thought about it. I definitely thought I needed a reason to live, but I became lethargic about me living without a reason. Since then, I have been doing my best in everything so that I don't regret it when I have a reason to live. My major was good and my school life was not bad, but I had a short break to find the reason, and I wanted to take a leave of absence from school, but I started playing jiu-jitsu, which I couldn't try because I was afraid of it, and I was able to participate in a competition and even finish second place. Also, I went on a working holiday in Canada to achieve my bucket list of wanting to live abroad. My life in another country where I couldn't communicate was lonely and difficult. I thought it was an experience problem due to my lack of English, so I changed my phone and laptop settings to English and made a lot of efforts to become familiar with it. However, the feelings of loneliness and fear did not disappear even as my English increased. Come to think of it, it was a matter of confidence, and I did a lot of actions that approached me first. I was able to build intimacy by going out to play with colleagues I worked with during the day-off and playing games with friends I met at Jiu-Jitsu. Even if they lack English, if they can communicate to some extent, their English skills, which they lack compared to their native friends, became an attractive point for them.Even if I got the grammar wrong, I was able to improve my English by laughing, teasing, and teaching the correct sentence. Later, even though English was not my first language, I was told that you were really good, and I was able to improve my ability to guide my friends who came from Korea during the trip to the U.S. Now that I think about it, I think that the first six months in Canada were a failure of myself not to act with confidence. I felt regret that I could have lived a better life in another country and left more good memories. Since then, I have a attitude of acting confidently. ""A bank that helps customers achieve their dreams."" I have never found a reason to live a life that was a question of my friend. As I know that dreams themselves are valuable, I wanted to protect the dreams of customers who trust and use them to achieve them. I think IBK is a bank that makes customers' present and future dreams come true. If I join the company under the slogan of ""IBK"" that fosters hope, I will contribute to safe infrastructure operation and service construction with various experiences I have accumulated, and I really want to help customers keep their dreams and realize them. I have a variety of job competencies required to keep my customers' dreams alive. I had to learn various languages such as C.C ++, Python, and assembly language because I needed to study inside and analyze the vulnerable source code based on white boxes. As a result, I was able to achieve good grades in a number of programming subjects, and in the case of security, it was very helpful to know how to attack it to secure it. I was able to learn more about the technical aspects by joining the security club on campus, conducting club studies, and presenting seminars. As a member of the corporate college student journalist group, I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field since I was in the lower grade. In the case of the military, I was assigned to the information protection soldier in my own university and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine server to manage nodes and PCs under the military. After that, while working on an IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage that use Bluetooth with an incumbent mentor. In the case of the project, I was able to receive bugbounties and letters of appreciation in recognition of the project's achievements. In addition, by writing a paper on how to trigger related vulnerabilities, I received the Outstanding Papers Award at the OOOOOO Association Winter Conference and the Outstanding Papers Award for undergraduate students at the OOOOOO Association. In addition, I won the grand prize at the 'Find OOO Security loopholes' competition hosted by OOOOOO. I applied to the Industrial Bank of Korea because I believe that I can find the reason for living my life if I use these capabilities to operate safe services and help achieve my dreams of becoming a diverse person. ""A little help was a big help."" I went to a working holiday, but there were good things and bad things. I thought that I would like to share what I felt in my life and to have a better life so that the prospective working holidays would not make the same mistakes as me. While wondering if there was a good way to do it, I learned about external activities conducted by OOOOO and was selected as an overseas correspondent so that I could share local news such as events and visits to local restaurants through the Internet. Also, after visiting the working holiday, I was selected as an OOO by OOO and was able to hold a briefing session and give counseling to prospective working holiday participants. After some time, I received a thank-you message from the people who received counseling that it was a successful working holiday, and I learned that my small help can be of great help to someone. I was also selected as a buddy assistant who can help international students on campus, and I tried to help my Ukrainian friend in living abroad. I thought that I was my family and acted with a little knowledge that I had gained through my experience in living abroad and that if I were in that situation. In recognition of these small efforts, I was able to receive an award from Minister OOO. As such, I want to be a part of the role of the community to develop together by receiving the part that I can help and receive help."
"""Next generation security leader who strives steadily"" Information security that I studied is also called the flower of IT because you need to know all areas of IT in general to secure security. So I always had to find out a lot to take a step ahead. When a smartphone came out, I studied application security, and when the Internet of Things came out, I always wondered and studied what was different about it. As I needed to analyze the vulnerable source code, I needed to learn various languages, and I needed to know how to attack to secure it, so I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. In addition, I was able to learn the basics of information security from seniors by joining an information protection club, and as a university student journalist, I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field. In the case of the military, I was assigned an information protection soldier in my own university and managed nodes under the supervision by operating equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine servers. In the case of the project, I was able to analyze the vulnerability of digital signage called digital electronic display boards in BoB activities, and in Han-eum, I was able to do a wireless security project. These experiences helped me to improve the security of the Korea Environment Corporation. ""The company that develops because of me"" I am a student who is very interested in information protection. When I was in high school, I only liked computer games and was not interested in information protection. However, while I was seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to a university department, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military as an information security guard. However, up to this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. However, I came to learn persistence by meeting good executives in the military. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit at the squad leader's training center on Onda. Before I left the military, I had always studied various fields only through superficial education, but after I was discharged from the military, I thought I should do it one by one step at a time, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. When I overcome these shortcomings and became a member of the Korea Environment Corporation with passion, which is my strength, I want to become a junior who is recognized by seniors by learning work step by step from the attitude of new employees. ""Perfect teamwork, perfect achievement."" Last year, I was selected for the next generation security leader training program run by the OOO Research Institute and the second course was to form a team under the theme of ""Digital Signage Vulnerability Analysis and Countermeasures."" All the team members worked hard on the project in their respective fields, and I wrote the thesis data on the results of the web/hardware vulnerability analysis on digital signage. Finally, a large Korean manufacturing company won the Best Paper Award for Compensation for Bug Bounty for Vulnerability Analysis, the Korea OOO Association's Software Conference, the Excellence Award at the Korea OOO Science Association, and the Best Prize at the Korea OOO Corporation's Software Comprehensive Papers Competition. This resulted in the best-ever result in the eight-term curriculums for training next-generation security leaders. ""Strong when Together."" I believe that when we live in a community, we should make sure to have colleagues around us, rather than those who are empty without them. Everyone takes for granted that they always have colleagues next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more relaxed than me. However, if you try to do that person's work instead of him or her, you will realize that it was more difficult than you thought to take a break. As the person in charge of anything is an expert, I think the value should be recognized and respected. As I was working on the project, each team member had a different progress schedule and method, so I had a hard time coordinating my disagreements about the project schedule. However, since we were a team, we conceded individual preferences, wrote WBS, divided the schedule into stages, and shared tasks. We also shared work status through collaborative tools. One team member specialized in analysis, so he often played a role in opening the door to the team members by analyzing binaries before finding vulnerabilities. The team member redistributed the rest of the work to other team members, and through this process, we were able to reach our purpose much faster. I think we were able to achieve results that we could not do alone because of the concessions from each other. ""Promotion of Local Relocation Due to the End of the Landfillment Period in the Seoul metropolitan area"" In line with the end of the landfill period and the promotion policy of local relocation of public enterprises, I understand that the government is promoting the relocation of the Korea Environment Corporation to the provinces. However, Incheon's regional characteristics are close to the Korea Environment Corporation's research characteristics and play a major role in measuring fine dust. For this reason, I think the symbolic meaning of the location of an environmental public enterprise in Incheon is also significant. Although the government's local relocation policy is promoted as the justification for the end of the landfill period in the Seoul metropolitan area, the Korea Environment Corporation emphasizes that there are many other tasks and believes that they should be excluded from the companies subject to local relocation. I believe that the government should also prioritize understanding what are the disadvantages in considering the environment, rather than the benefits of balanced regional development. ""Passion, the driving force of my dreams,"" I am a passionate person. When electronic devices broke down, I had a hobby of disassembling and fixing them myself. Of course, there were times when they didn't work out, and sometimes they hurt themselves, but when they were fixed, I felt good and was interested in solving the problem. During my military life, I was assigned to the information protection team and worked. By managing PCs and servers under the military army, I improved my understanding of security settings. Later, while working on an IT project, I was able to analyze security weaknesses and other security weaknesses with my current mentor. Many will use these experiences to contribute to the stable and continuous operation of the Korea Environment Corporation and the improvement of the security of the system.I have studied information protection for a long time, and I think I have the potential to develop further. I will develop and develop this potential with the seniors who are working."
"""Applicant with practical experience"" When I was a student, I worked at the OOO OOO OOO OOO Protection Support Center as an intern for industry-academia cooperation. The OOO Protection Support Center is in charge of planning, implementing, and supporting education for small and medium enterprises/college students who do not have easy access to information protection. While working as an intern, I was selected as the next generation security leader training program operated by the OOO Research Institute last year. Information protection services for small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses are available for analysis of web vulnerabilities in the OOO area. - Product and service status survey (Korea and overseas), information protection education operation plan for employees of small and medium-sized enterprises and college students in the OO area (curriculum, personnel, period, promotional methods, etc.), and by practicing preparing summary report on information protection measures of Japanese SMEs, I was able to familiarize myself with the current status of SMEs. I believe that the experience of security support for SMEs will help the society pursued by the Small and Medium Venture Business Corporation. ""Perfect teamwork, perfect achievement."" Last year, I was selected for the next generation security leader training program operated by the OOO Research Institute of Korea and as the second course, I formed a team under the theme of ""Digital Signage Vulnerability Analysis and Countermeasures."" All of the team members worked hard on the project in their respective fields, and I wrote a paper on the results of the web/hardware vulnerability analysis on digital signage. Finally, OOO Electronics won the Best Paper Award at the CISCW Conference held by the OO Association, the Excellence Award at the Software Conference of the OO Science Association, the Excellence Award at the Undergraduate Papers Competition held by the OO Association of Korea. We were able to win the Best Prize at the 'Find the OO Security loophole' contest held by the OO Safety Corporation. This was the best result in the eight-term curriculums for training the next generation of security leaders. ""Strong when we are together."" When we live together in a community, I think that we should make our colleagues around us, rather than empty people without them. Everyone takes it for granted that they always have colleagues next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more relaxed than I am. However, if you try to do that person's work in lieu of you, you will feel that it was more difficult to take a break. As the person in charge of anything is an expert, I think you should recognize and respect their value. As I was working on the project, each team member had a different schedule and method of progress, so I had a hard time coordinating my differences over the project schedule. There were pros and cons of the team members, and accordingly, there was a convenient way for each team member. However, as we were a team, we were able to actively cooperate by giving up individual preferences and giving priority to the words of the PM, who was well aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the team members. PM assigned tasks to what each team member could do well, and since the rest of the team members were also good at reverse engineering, there was a team member who was only good at reverse engineering. In the case of this friend, he was specialized in analysis, so he played a role in opening the door to other team members by analyzing binaries before finding vulnerabilities. Through this friend's analytical ability, we were able to reach the goal much faster. I think we were able to achieve results that we could not do on our own thanks to each other's concessions. As I studied information protection, ""passion, the driving force of dreams,"" I came to think it was difficult but fun. I was able to learn more about the technical aspects by joining a hacking/security club on campus, conducting club studies, and presenting seminars. The military also applied as a computer soldier and received an information security soldier and worked. By managing the PCs and servers under the Corps, I was able to learn more about the importance of information protection, and I prepared/audited various security audits to enhance my understanding of security settings. After that, while working on the IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage using Bluetooth with my mentor in the office. If there are many, many, and if there are few, I will use these experiences to contribute to the improvement of the security of the Small and Medium Venture Business Corporation. ""The next generation security leader who strives steadily"" I did a lot of activities related to my application job. In particular, I focused a lot on information security. Information security is also called the flower of IT because you need to know all areas of IT in general to be secure. So I always had to find out a lot to be one step ahead. When a smartphone comes out, I study about application security, and when the Internet of Things comes out, I always wondered and studied what is different about it. Since it was necessary to analyze the vulnerable source code, I needed to learn various languages, and I needed to know how to attack to secure it, so I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. In response, I tried to increase my expertise by setting up the security settings again and retrying the attack, such as how is it secured or whether there is no other way around. In addition, I was able to learn the basics of information security from seniors by joining an information protection club, and became a college student journalist, so I was able to learn a lot about what was going on in the information security field from the lower grade. And in the case of the military, I was assigned an information protection soldier in my own university and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine servers to manage nodes under the supervision. In the case of the project, I was able to analyze the vulnerability of digital signage called digital electronic boards in BoB activities, and in Han-eum, I was able to do a wireless security project."
"""Power Supply"" When I was a freshman in high school, I left my apartment for 12 years and moved to a new one. After moving in, a typhoon called Prapiroon hit Korea in August, and I experienced a power outage I had never experienced. When I woke up from my sleep and the house was in a mess, my mother and father turned on the flashlight on my cell phone and informed me that a power outage occurred. At this time, our entire apartment suffered a power outage for about an hour. During the blackout, we didn't have access to air conditioners, refrigerators, and even bathroom lights. The experience that electricity, which we always took for granted, disappeared instantly like this to understand the importance of stable power supply. Based on what I learned in programming class, I became interested in the fields of communication and development by realizing socket communication with thermal imaging cameras. Since then, I have experienced things like building web servers in projects. In addition, at the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, one of the intelligent transportation system services, we tried to develop a small model and management website in a short time of 42.195 hours by thinking of a variable lane that changes according to traffic volume, and I was in charge of developing an API server between the hardware and the website in this project. We built a server that receives traffic volume from hardware and informs the calculated variable lane through the website. Working for KEPCO, I would like to try to reduce the power failure time by closing the fault section and transmitting power through the bypass distribution line even if a power failure occurs through stable maintenance of the distribution intelligence communication network (DAS). In addition, I want to contribute to the improvement of the stability of the operation of large-scale AMI communication network by making efforts to advance the intelligent remote meter reading system (AMI). I want to contribute to the construction of servers for two-way information service of smart grids. I think one of the important concepts of smart grid business is the exchange of power usage information between electricity providers and electricity users. Also, a small concept server will be needed in order for individual power facilities to be connected to each other and exchange information. During the in-school software development competition held while in high school, my team computerized functions such as inquiring about penalty points, applying for songs, renting laptops, and managing access, shared information on the web and apps, and built a central server for hardware control and consistent processing to implement a real-time web page. While building a server that has to support various platforms such as web pages, hardware, and apps, I received the Excellence Award by setting consistent communication rules and implementing them so that I can easily access the central server and take information from various platforms. In the case of the dormitory laptop rental system, which was implemented by the change of the dormitory laptop rental method, I have experience in building a server where the application page is opened at a certain time and many requests are generated in a short time. At first, there was a problem of slowing down the processing of the server when many requests occurred, but I reduced the load on the server by changing the method of the server to distribute and process the user's requests across various processes. Through the above experience, I want to document and process the information produced by various power facilities and ensure that the server does not stop even if a large amount of data occurs. In addition, I would like to contribute to the creation of a consumer-oriented power market ecosystem through interactive information services between users and power management systems by allowing users of the smart meter to directly inquire information such as their real-time power usage through communication efficiency between the power management system and the data concentration device. At the end-of-year software development festival held on campus, our team tried to create a notification and communication website for students and teachers on campus. At first, during the development meeting, most of our team members were familiar with web development, so they tried to develop the website, and that's how they tried to develop it. Then, one of the team members underestimated his ability and refused to participate, saying there was nothing they could do. At first, I just thought that it was because they didn't want to do it. I think there can always be friction or conflict in human relationships. So, I decided to ask the team member if he wanted to develop something other than what he could do and the direction of the project he was working on, and listen to him. When I talked with the team member, I learned that he wanted to develop an app that he was more interested in. At first, I thought I simply didn't want to do it, but I came to reflect on myself for judging without even talking. After hearing that, I talked with all the team members and changed the direction of development by dividing the web service that was originally intended to be developed into a website using an API server and an Android application. All of the team members participated by changing the direction of development by communicating separately, and I played roles such as API server and development schedule management. It was a development festival that I did not learn much, and there were many difficulties in developing it by proceeding it at a time when I did not learn much, but still, a visible product came out, and the festival successfully displayed and presented. ""Development of an after-school course registration website"" The existing after-school class registration website was used by the school using a solution from an external company, paying a monthly fee. While using the site, I thought of additional functions such as the inconvenience of applying for after-school classes and the password that is initialized every time, so I told the teacher in charge that I wanted to develop an after-school website as a project so that students could use it at school. The teacher in charge had high expectations that if the students developed it, the cost of the monthly solution used by the school could be used to improve the quality of after-school classes. The project was carried out by two front-end developers, two back-end developers, one design, and five people.The project was carried out in the order of function design, design and development schedule establishment, front-end development, back-end development, pre-deployment test, manual creation, and distribution. I was in charge of function design and back-end development, manual production, API document production, and I was able to create an efficient course registration website by continuously discussing with the front-end development team. The website supports functions such as after-school course registration, change, cancellation, announcement, satisfaction survey, demand survey, and teacher introduction. Unlike the websites of external companies, functions such as satisfaction survey, announcement, demand survey, and teacher introduction have been added. The project was successfully completed. As a result, the school reduced the cost of solutions, and students were able to conduct after-school classes and satisfaction surveys they wanted to listen to on one website. In addition, with the reduced solution cost, the budget for textbooks and snacks for after-school classes helped improve the quality of after-school classes."
"We have made the following efforts to equip KEPCO KDN with creativity, expertise, customer orientation, and reliability. ""We have changed the way we apply for after-school classes."" The website for applying for after-school classes, which was previously used on campus, was used by the school by paying a monthly fee using a solution from an external company. While using the site, I told the teacher in charge that I would like to develop the website as a project so that students can use it at school, considering additional functions such as the inconvenience of applying for after-school classes and the password that is initialized every time. The project was carried out in the order of function design, design and development schedule, front-end development, back-end development, pre-distribution test, manual production, and API documentation. I was in charge of function design and back-end development, manual production, and API documentation, and I was able to create an effective course registration website by continuously discussing with the front-end development team. ""We have developed a website that facilitates the life of dormitory students."" In my school, where I lived in dormitory, I had to take my laptop to the dormitory every day by filling out a laptop rental register located in a specific place for self-directed learning. We proceeded with a two-person project and established a PHP-based website for practical use. We have improved our IT system management capabilities by reflecting the user's requirements, checking for problems or errors that occur during actual use, and blocking access to the macro. In addition, we restricted the ports connected to the server to prevent leakage of laptop application information, ID, and personal information, and took measures to notify them by e-mail when requested or when illegal access was made, and stored information that did not need to be decrypted, such as user's password and laptop application information, by one-way encryption. KEPCO KDN is a company that provides services such as power system management by applying advanced ICT technology to all processes of the power system. In addition, we support stable advanced ICT technology to power customers and suppliers for stable and efficient power supply. Electric power supply is an essential element in the lives of the people, and KEPCO KDN is responsible for providing the supply and support of advanced ICT technology in this power supply. ""As a self-governing committee for dormitories, I developed, operated, and maintained websites related to dormitories."" Based on my experience in managing IT systems such as dormitory management websites and laptop rental websites, I can provide stable power ICT services through monitoring, continuous inspection, and maintenance of power ICT services such as transmission and substation automation systems and power system operation systems. ""I have experience in developing a central API server."" At the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, I carried out a project to create a variable lane model and program according to changes in traffic volume. I received traffic volume information from hardware, calculated a more efficient variable lane system through traffic volume calculation, and developed a central API server that provides current information and calculation information to the website. Based on the above experience, I believe that I can contribute to supplying and supporting advanced ICT technologies by carrying out website development and server development tasks such as developing a central system server of KEPCO KDN's transmission and substation automation system. ""Job Training for Building Practical Experience"" The experience of participating in competitions and projects on and off campus is also important, but I wanted to learn work in the actual field. As a result, I was dispatched to the job training of the industry on campus to assist in actual development work. I was in charge of analyzing the loan, investment consultation, and completion status through the company's SNS and implementing it so that it can be checked every certain time. To solve this task, I used a user behavior analysis tool called Amplitude. This information has been parsed into Python and implemented to periodically provide the information through AWS Lambda on the company's SNS consisting of Slack. Unlike what I learned at school and experienced during the project, I experienced a lot of additional functions when I used and used it in my actual company. In addition, it helped me understand how the company conducts and promotes work through periodic meetings, team members, and employee meetings while proceeding with this development. ""Development of a dormitory laptop rental site"" The number of students in the dormitory study room has been limited due to COVID-19. At this time, the dormitory self-governing committee decided to receive the use of the study room by the students on a first-come, first-served basis, and since it was difficult to conduct it offline, it was decided to develop a new dormitory laptop rental website. In a short period of five days, I was in charge of server construction and backend development. When it was first introduced, many users flocked to the same time, causing the system to slow down. So, even if we access at the same time, we have optimized the number of times we communicate with the database and client to ensure that the system does not slow down even if a large number of requests occur. There were no additional functions due to the lack of time to develop a single system in a short period of time, but we actually experienced requests from many users and how important it is to optimize the algorithms handled by the server. ""We solved the situation where response speed and security conflict in the local courier system."" We created a blockchain-based local courier service produced at the 5th OO OOO Competition in Korea. When a customer receives a package, the token owned by the customer is pre-verified to all users before passing it to the local courier, and the token is paid through the transaction after the verification. The system is very secure, but when the number of users increases during actual service, the response speed is very slow. The pre-transaction verification process has been changed.The ledger owned by the customer was compared with the ledger of the local courier, 10 inspectors were randomly extracted, and the central server was changed to supervise it. Due to the nature of the local courier service to be implemented, the central server was changed to verify this transaction because it is a blockchain system that requires the central server of the Post Office. At first, there was an opinion that it was against the blockchain system, but in the case of corporate blockchains, a central server exists and the central server only supervises the verification process itself, so it cannot affect inspectors and traders. I think the speed of response experienced by customers is very important. However, in order for the service to remain stable, security is important, so we prioritized security and tried to reduce response time. KEPCO KDN is a company that provides total services applied with advanced power ICT technology to companies such as KEPCO, and I think that cooperation with other companies and institutions will be frequent. Therefore, as an employee of a public institution pursuing the public interest, a sense of ethics will work more importantly. While working as the Dormitory Autonomy Committee, there was a request from ordinary students to disclose the contents of the Dormitory Steering Committee. Disclosure of information would result in additional review and work, but I wanted to receive better complaints. All the contents that can be disclosed to ordinary students should be disclosed through the minutes, and the contents of the meeting were proposed to the dormitory management committee to collect questions and complaints through the complaint window, and the contents of the meeting were disclosed from the next session. Since the disclosure, ordinary students have given ideas about the contents of the steering committee. When working through this, I felt that the interests of the whole group should be given priority over the interests of the individual. As a public institution that provides essential services to the lives of the people, I believe that all employees should work with the right ethical consciousness. Therefore, rather than pursuing individual interests, I think we should pursue a work method that pursues the public interest and the interests of the company."
"I have the advantage of having gained knowledge of programming languages while I was in high school. In the web programming class, I learned how to structure a basic web page, and in the programming class for the first time, I gained programming thinking and basic knowledge by learning the C language. The skills I have have built up my ability to write programs through several software projects in high school. In addition, after I became interested in web pages, I made a website for dormitory management during the software engineering class and provided real Internet services using a real MySQL database and a Linux server. In addition, when I was in the first year of high school, I learned the Java programming language to study object-oriented programming. In the 6th Korea SW Convergence Hackathon, my team developed a small model and a management website with the idea of a variable lane that changes according to traffic volume, an intelligent transportation system service using SW convergence technology, and succeeded in developing it in a short time of 42195 hours In my school, where I lived in dormitories, I had to take my laptop to a certain place every day to fill out a laptop rental register for self-directed learning. It was very uncomfortable for me that I had to fill out a laptop rental register every time I borrowed a laptop to take my laptop to the dormitories. So I suggested adding a feature that allows me to fill out the laptop rental register online when I set up a dormitory management website. So, students can access the dormitory management website with their laptops, log in to fill out the notebook rental register for the job, and provide a system that provides students with the convenience of students, the status of the dormitory laptop rental, and outputs visible in real time. The management of the dormitory board and the dormitory supervisor was also made simple. Some people think that the handwritten laptop rental that they take for granted has brought the convenience of both students and managers by allowing them to write the rental register using their laptops. In high school, while working on a team project, one of my team members underestimated his ability and did not try because he wanted to implement an app that provided a simple service that he originally proposed. However, other team members wanted to implement a web service by building an embedded system, so we decided to build an embedded system and a web service that many team members wanted. When his opinion was not reflected, he underestimated his ability and said he would not participate. So, my team member and I decided to provide additional app services, which is an area that the team member is good at, and we proposed to the team member again how to build a backend server by converting it from the original web service to a central API server, and successfully implemented and introduced all of the embedded system web apps. If we meet a team member with a similar tendency after joining the company, we will properly collect the opinions of the team member and do our best to prevent departure by making every effort to reflect the validity of the opinions and to some extent, not just the opinions of the majority. The Korea Financial Information Service operates and manages the digital budget accounting system, dBrain, and the national government subsidy integration platform, e-country help, and financial statistics. It is understood that the next-generation budget accounting system is being built. Once this next-generation budget accounting system is newly established, it will enable efficient financial management, detect duplicate projects, predict appropriate balances of state funds, and integrate and manage national financial information. It will contribute to the development of society as a whole to create social values by contributing to the development of society. Based on what we learned in high school microprocessor classes and programming classes, I think it can contribute to streamlining tasks that require a lot of traffic and multiple operations a day. I would like to design a normalized DB in the system and perform minimal operations, so that stable services can be provided despite many requests. The case in which I solved the problem by demonstrating my leadership was a school called Self-directed Career Experience Activities, in which about 68 students of the same grade went on a three-day trip for self-directed career experience activities. All students produced and submitted one plan per person, gathered these plans, selected a good plan, and led the students to make reservations, research, and recruit guidance teachers. I submitted a plan under the theme of Cultural Experience Activities and Career Experience Volunteering, and I was selected to go to Seoul with six friends including myself for self-directed career experience activities. Although it was difficult to do various documentation activities such as writing a spending resolution and processing receipts for the first time, I was selected as an excellent team leader after completing the self-directed career experience activities by carefully writing them and encouraging the team members. These activities gave team members an opportunity to learn how to achieve their team's goals by allowing them to communicate with each other by periodically sharing the progress and collecting opinions. Through this leadership, I think I can contribute to the team's performance by continuously communicating with the team members after joining the company so that the direction does not go wrong"
"I have the execution power to always challenge myself like Hyundai's GV80. Genesis started out as a sedan, succeeded in positioning itself in luxury, and achieved outstanding brand power. However, Hyundai Motor did not settle for success and launched its luxury SUV, bringing about another success with the title of 'the first domestic premium SUV.' I think the GV80's symbol of constant challenge looks like me. I studied programming, basic statistics, and machine learning while working at big data conferences for a year. I formed a team with the goal of gaining analysis experience and participated in six contests. I was able to prove my skills by winning three awards, but I was not complacent. Even after finishing the conference's activities, I learned deep learning techniques that were not in the curriculum, and tried to acquire collaboration skills by studying Git. I think this challenging execution power is an attitude required of workers in the fast-developing big data field. Hyundai Motor's global internship is also an extension of this challenge. I want to actively reflect on my analysis capabilities in my business through internships. I would like to access the high-quality customer data that Hyundai Motor has accumulated over a long period of time to discover unknown insights. The amount of variables will be significant because Hyundai Motor's customer data is collected from various channels such as sales sites, the web, and apps. I would like to apply various methodologies to find the criteria for customer segmentation by exploring all variables one by one. While studying data analysis, I was interested in customer data. I enjoyed the process of analyzing people's behavior in multiple dimensions and finding meaning. It was interesting that this intern analyzed customer data, derived results, and established strategies together through cooperation. We decided that the project could create synergy and promote personal growth. Considering the specificity and cooperation of the data, I think customer data affinity and communication skills are required. Through the competition, I received credit information and card consumption data by customer type from OOO, analyzed, and produced a dashboard. Based on the analysis results, I created a variable called customer type by using the variables of card consumption and loan type compared to income. Types such as 'blind eyes' and 'witted' were visualized as icons and placed in the center. I created a dashboard with a structure in which different analysis results are placed around it to explain the types. It was recognized for its user-friendliness in OOO and won third place. Understanding customer data learned a lesson that you also need to understand customers. I worked as an intern at OOO last year and developed communication skills. In the process of collecting the list of OO products sold on overseas websites, I tried to automate work by using R. The team had about 60 different websites, and it was difficult for them to come up with the code that fits the structure of each site alone. We needed a way to handle our work efficiently without burdening our team members. Accordingly, we provided the team members with data forms for crawling and a form that summarizes the characteristics of the website. Using the collected information, we were able to easily understand the structure of the website. We produced about 40 codes in two months while reproducing about two codes a day. The team members used them in turn and shortened the work time from 5 to 3 days. We realized that we could improve work efficiency through cooperation. I participated in the 6th OOOO Big Data Competition last year and proved my excellent problem-solving ability. Our team came up with a model that recommends products to non-member online customers for supervised learning for classification purposes. The problem was the performance of the model. Since the model was learned targeting 1,600 different kinds of products, the given variables were not enough to explain. I tried to use weather data additionally and processing existing variables, but they were not enough. In this situation, the variables I paid attention to were the traditional marketing factors, gender and age. It was found that the relative proportion of purchasing certain products differs according to gender and age, such as ""Men in their 20s are drinking beverages and women in their 40s are meat."" Although we judged that ratio was an important variable, there was a limitation that it could not be applied to non-members who did not leave personal information. At this time, we came up with a method of treating missing values with supervised learning models. We thought that we could identify the gender and age of non-member customers and use them as variables. Accordingly, we designed a dual structure algorithm that identifies non-members with a model learned from member data and recommends products by using it as a variable. The results were amazing. When tested assuming that some of the member data were non-members, the model that identifies gender and age showed 86% accuracy, and the product recommendation showed 50% accuracy. The importance of the two variables in the model also appears high, allowing us to verify the explanatory power of the dual structure. The availability of marketing elements and algorithm-based recommendation performance were emphasized during the final screening. In recognition of its creativity and excellence, it was praised for being the ""most unique among the participants"" and received the top prize. I was able to develop flexible thinking that solves problems by using existing methodologies creatively, not just as they are."
"""Steady Growth for Vision AI"" Vision AI is a promising field that can be applied not only to robots or autonomous driving but also to the game industry. In 2015, I became interested in Vision AI when I heard that AI exceeded the recognition rate of human vision with the advent of ResNet. I developed a game based on image recognition in the Capstone design project on campus and learned basic knowledge of computer vision. It was a game where the score obtained by driving the sign object recognized while controlling the RC car was evaluated. It was a good opportunity to think about how to optimize Vision AI by reflecting it in game elements. I went to a master's degree to study Vision AI in more depth. I mainly conducted industry-academia projects that researched computer vision algorithms such as detection and recognition for objects using deep learning. I wanted to develop myself constantly even during the period when I did not carry out industry-academia projects, and I told the professor about it, and he helped me with projects from outside companies and gave me the opportunity to experience practical affairs. For six months, I developed an OCR algorithm based on deep learning to be applied to embedded. Object Tracking and Object Recognition algorithms were implemented for image analysis required in a real-time environment. We experienced various issues such as the necessity of lightweight deep learning, data inflation, and anomaly detection, and we grew by solving problems that we could not learn only with research. We have developed our capabilities in computer vision and deep learning through various project experiences. Furthermore, I applied to NCsoft, which is leading the innovation of the entertainment business, in order to become the subject of game development applied with Vision AI technology in the future. Based on the VIsion AI research experience, it will help to quickly grasp and develop the development flow. In my fourth year of undergraduate school, ""Achievement of goals through constant improvement"", I was encouraged by my supervisor to link the capstone design project to the nation's largest ICT contest. About 430 teams participated and only 16 teams received main awards, so our team, which lacked project experience at the time, knew that it was difficult to win the award. However, we set a goal of challenging the award through constant efforts and started the project with the support of our supervisor. Before submitting to the contest, we first received an interim evaluation on campus. Contrary to expectations that I would receive good reviews, I was criticized by professors for failing to present clear results and being fed up with my ideas, and I was given the result that I was last in the department. It was difficult to think that the project I had been preparing had failed, but I didn't want to disappoint my supervisor. Once I experienced the last place, I felt that there was no reason to be afraid of failure anymore, and I decided to use this as an opportunity to blessing in disguise and start the project again. Fortunately, the team members were not frustrated with the failure, and with the determination to do their best, I focused on development by reducing sleep. We changed the direction of the project to elements that people would sympathize with and like more, and systematically planned the development process again. When more professional opinions were needed, I visited as many professors and company practitioners as possible, listened actively to their advice, and looked for improvements. As it said, ""Efforts do not betray,"" we won first place in the on-campus engineering competition, and in the ICT competition, we were ranked in the top 10 out of 430 teams and received the main award. Even if we experienced failure, we were able to achieve our goal thanks to consistently improving the project without giving up. It was the best experience to complete the project safely, giving the professor the joy of success. Vision AI is a technology that is still developing, so I think it is important to have an enterprising attitude to do anything for research and development. During my master's degree, I developed an enterprising spirit by working on a project related to deep learning vision called 'Research on Intelligent Automatic Programming Technology for Web Applications'. Since my affiliated lab is a new lab, I have been the head of the lab since the first semester of my master's degree, and I often coordinated my work on behalf of the advisor, who was away often due to busyness. It was unfamiliar because it was my first role, but I worked with an enterprising attitude thinking that I was entrusted by the professor, so I worked with it. I was in charge of implementing the overall back-end Vision AI algorithm, and I shared the roles of the front-end and deep learning data learning for the other motives. It was my first time encountering a project related to deep learning, but I faithfully performed my role, while sharing information that could be helpful for the work of other motives. At the end of the development, I was in charge of business trips for TTA certification and patent applications on behalf of my advisor. I was afraid because I was unfamiliar with both tasks, but I prepared the data by meticulously organizing the principles of the main algorithms and the experimental results with the responsibility of the program I made myself. I passionately pursued my work and safely completed TTA certification, and I also successfully registered a patent. While performing this task, I became accustomed to explaining the differentiation and excellence of certain principles in an easy-to-understand manner, and I wrote my research in a paper and won the top thesis award at an academic conference. I gained confidence that I could do anything if I took an enterprising attitude even if it was my first encounter. Even after joining the company, I will always be reborn as a researcher working on development with an enterprising spirit of challenge and passion for Vision AI."
"Last year, while working as an intern at OOOO, I immersed myself in crawling with the aim of automating my work. The main task was collecting the list of OO products sold on overseas websites. The team members felt tired from the simple repetition work of finding products one by one and writing them in Excel, and there was a setback in the task of collecting information from 50 websites a week. To improve the situation, I tried to automate my work using R, which I was studying personally. Even after work, I studied the code separately, collected product lists from the five websites and compared them with existing results. There was no significant error from the method of collecting by hand, so I reset the goal of expanding to other websites. However, it was difficult to apply the existing method of R to websites with complex structures, and I had difficulty in organizing many codes alone. While thinking about it, I asked my senior in the data analysis department for advice and was encouraged to use Python. Although I had a vague fear of learning a new language, I started studying with a sense of mission that I could improve the work efficiency of the team. Fortunately, I was able to easily learn Python because I had the basics of coding with R. With the ability to utilize Python, I was able to develop my ability to cope with various dynamic elements of the web. In addition, I provided the team members with data forms for crawling and forms that summarize the characteristics of the website. Using the information collected by the team members, I was able to easily grasp the structure of the rest of the website. I quickly reproduced about three codes a day. As a result, we produced about 40 codes in three months, and the team members used them one by one, reducing the time required to work from five to three days. I learned that small attempts can have a positive impact on the organization. Last year, I participated in the OOO Big Data Competition and proposed a unique structure of algorithms that used marketing elements. Our team came up with a model to recommend products to non-member online customers for supervised learning for classification purposes. The problem was the performance of the model. Since the model was learned with 1,600 different types of products as the target, the given variables were not enough to explain. I applied weather data and processed and used existing variables, but they were not enough. In this situation, the variables I paid attention to were the traditional marketing elements, gender, and age. It was found that the relative proportion of purchasing a specific product differs according to gender and age, such as ""drink for men in their 20s and meat for women in their 40s."" Although it was judged to be an important variable, it could not be applied to non-members who did not leave personal information. At this point, I came up with a method of treating missing values with a supervised learning model. I thought I could identify the gender and age of non-member customers and use them as variables. Accordingly, we designed a dual-structure algorithm that identifies non-members based on the model learned from the member data and recommends products by using it as a variable. The results were surprising. When tested assuming some of the member data as non-members, the model that identifies gender and age showed 86% accuracy, and the product recommendation 50% accuracy. The importance of the two variables in the model also appears high, so the explanatory power of the dual structure can be verified. The main screening emphasized the availability of marketing elements and algorithm-based recommendation performance. In recognition of its creativity and excellence, it was praised for being the ""most unique"" among the participants and received the top prize. It was realized that novelty comes from familiarity. Type: International Company: OOO Corporation Department: Content Planning Team Period: 2019.09-11 [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) OOO is a startup that operates a big data competition platform as a 'Korean Cagle'. I worked as an intern at OOO and was in charge of running the competition. Before the competition, I received data from the client, preprocessed it in a form suitable for machine learning, and briefly analyzed the data. After the competition was over, the winner's code was verified and analyzed. While working on the operation, I was able to experience raw data from various fields such as electricity usage, traffic volume, and satellite images. In addition, I was able to learn quality insights while analyzing the winner's code. Type: Contest: Organizing/Hosting: OOO Financial Style Visualization Contest: OOO/OOO Period: 2019.07 - 08 Result: Third Place [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) I was in charge of creating a dashboard for credit inquiry service using the tableau. I thought about what kind of content I needed from my users and created a variable called customer type based on my income and credit score. Types such as 'blind eyes' and 'witted' were visualized with icons and placed in the center. A dashboard was created with a structure where different analysis results were placed around it to explain the types. As a result, KCB won third place in recognition of its user-friendliness. It was a special experience to understand the situation of platform users instead of codes and familiar analysts. Type: Club Club: OOO (OOO) Period: 2019.01 - 2020.03 [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) I learned machine learning techniques using R and Python at the big data conference. While studying theory and code at the same time, I studied what packages to use in each language to apply the techniques. To verify the learning results, I teamed up with members of the conference to participate in a contest and achieve results. Even after finishing the year-long session, we proceeded with a stock price prediction project, and continued to study deep learning based on TensorFlow, and did not let go of the keyboard. While struggling with debugging in the flood of various codes, I was able to have a strong mind that did not fear the codes I met for the first time. Type: Competition: KBO OPS Performance Modeling/Visualization Competition Host/supervision: OOO Period: 2019.03 - 07 Result: 5th Place [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) As the team leader, I combined the analysis code performed by the team member into a single report and interpreted the final result. The key was to reduce the number of baseball players' performance variables and apply clustering techniques. I thought I fully understood it at the planning stage, but there were difficulties in interpreting and merging the code.I was able to understand the context step by step by step by looking at the code line by line with each team member and asking questions, and through such efforts, I was able to derive a meaningful interpretation of 'the growth type of others'. It was an experience to learn the importance of communication in the project. Type: Competition: OOOO Academy Competition: Organized/organized: OOOO Date: 2019.08 Result: None [Details] (within 10 paragraphs) The challenge was to predict demand for the cafeteria using OOO's own data analysis platform. I was in charge of creating a random forest model using the analysis platform. I was able to find some inconveniences while using the platform myself. It was an opportunity to think about the factors that the platform should have, taking into account the limitations of model types, complex non-preprocessing APIs, and uniform debugging. Although it was not a successful competition, it was an experience to test the beta version and understand the platform that the company would use."
"I heard that there will be a thesis competition held at the OOO conference, ""The Best Prize I Ever Did."" Therefore, I submitted a thesis to find out what I could do within that field. When I first decided to write a thesis, I aimed for the top prize. However, since most of the participants were graduate students in the master's and doctoral programs, I thought that my chances of winning the thesis might be slim. However, I believed that if I tried harder than them and went in a good direction on a topic during the given time, I would achieve my goal. I had to complete a thesis in less than two months, so I had difficulty managing my time. In particular, it took more time than planned to acquire relevant knowledge by setting the theme of ""OOOOOOOO technology."" I felt very nervous about not falling behind my competitors. However, I thought that I could overcome it only by trying harder than I lacked. I read as many papers as possible from famous overseas journals, and I completed them by modifying the code day and night, regardless of weekends. After all these efforts, I was able to submit my thesis in a timely manner, and I was highly appreciated for incorporating the latest technologies into my thesis, so I won the Best Papers Prize. ""Early adopter seeking efficiency"" I was in charge of collecting Internet comments while working as an intern at OOO company. Many interns copied and pasted their writings over and over again. However, I thought this process was inefficient and wanted to implement an efficient system through programming. When I reported to the team leader that I would study about the related technology, he received a good idea. However, since I had to finish the work within the period, if I could not secure the technology within the promised period, I decided to use the existing method. If I failed, it could be a waste of time, but I thought that there would be no progress without challenges, so I boldly executed it. That's how I learned about web crawling. It was a technology that fetched texts and pictures that existed on the web, and through the latest package called N2H4, I was able to implement it in R, a programming language. Through this, I was able to finish the work quickly, and I made a program file so that other interns could easily use it. I don't think that investing a lot of time will unconditionally pay off. I think it will be better to understand how to work efficiently within a given time and use new technologies if there are any. I will not be a person who recklessly goes to work and spends time, but a C&C person of SK Corporation who thinks for better results and knows how to incorporate new things."
"""Face Recognition Cosmetics Trial MakeApp"" When I was in fourth grade, I had the experience of creating the MakeApp application while taking the Software Engineering class. As a team project, I learned the software engineering process that I learned in class and applied the process directly to the project. ""MakeApp"" produced by the project is an application that provides Face Recognition Cosmetics Trial service. It is a basic camera application that directly trial cosmetics on the face through face recognition and connects websites for purchasing. There are two reasons why this project was interesting. First, I realized that software engineering documentation work was very important. To plan and implement software, it goes through the processes of User Requirements, Design, Testing, and Maintenance. Software engineering such as ""Design"" gave a different feeling from the project that I planned in my head and proceeded with coding right away. I was able to do more systematic and fast distributed work by dividing the implementation by requirements with my team members. In the implementation stage, I took charge of three requirements including 'View Cosmetics Information to Buy', which crawls the REST API over the network and implemented them. The most impressive experience was in the testing stage. For me, it was the first testing I experienced after programming. When testing was conducted based on requirements, I realized how important the software structure I had set in advance was. In reality, there was no big problem, but I set the testing scope in advance so I could see in detail which part I needed to check. I had previously worked on an engineering documentation project in the subject of 'Domain Analysis and SW Design', but I remember that it was difficult due to many trials and errors. However, in this project, it was my second engineering work, so I felt more comfortable and familiar. Second, it was my first English class and I worked with foreign friends, so it was a very memorable project. During the project, we communicated for about four months thinking that both our foreign and Korean friends made the same software. I was impressed by the leadership of my foreign friend, the leader, and it was an experience that I first felt that programming languages are a common language in the world. ""Dream of becoming a Software Engineer"" I tried to acquire the software engineering skills by taking SW-related courses step by step. In the 1st and 2nd grades, I gained basic programming knowledge and skills starting with C language. I got good grades in the basic programming course, so I started to dream of becoming a software engineer. And in the 2nd grade, I developed basic computer knowledge and programming skills by taking tasks such as MIPS Simulator and Shell implementation. In the 3rd and 4th grades, I conducted practical software projects by taking ""Domain Analysis and SW Design"", ""Software Engineering"", and project subjects. While taking the courses, I realized that software engineering specification/documentation such as Requirements, Design, Testing, and Maintenance is very important, not just to develop them. In addition, I developed the SmartHome IoT application in the Mobile Programming class. I used Raspberry Pi to operate the sensor and implemented the function to control it on mobile through Bluetooth connection. I remember that I was very excited and implemented a practical project for the first time. In fact, I created a model house and released a Demo application. ""A rare tester part-time job."" I have worked at a mobile game company for about two months. This company makes mobile games that simulate dramas. My duties were planning work assistant and testing. I personally looked at the scenarios and planned the screen to see if the flow of the game matches the scenario, and looked for any bugs. Due to the nature of the game company that produces dramas based on them, we had to update the conference chapters that were aired every week, and we had to run all of the two chappers' tests for a week. It was not easy to run and report all the tests in time, and then retest the new games that were supplemented. However, it was nice to be able to correct the errors I found and to release the finished version every week so that I could immediately see user reviews. Through this part-time job experience, I was able to feel the difficulty and interest of QA work at the same time. I knew that there were separate development and QA jobs because I usually like games, but I thought it was just a testing job. However, when I looked up the specific work of the QA team, I realized that it was not just a job to test. Quality Assistance (QA) is a quality control team. It is responsible for determining the quality of the product as a whole if the project fits the purpose. Test engineers (TE) are part of QA. They often misunderstand QA as TE, which is an activity that reveals defects in SW. On the other hand, QA is also required much more ability than simple TE because it also serves to prevent further damage by informing the planning team of the problem if there is a problem with planning. I think this job requires empathy, observation, and programming skills.From a user's point of view, we should look at whether this SW is valuable or uncomfortable, and think about how to give feedback to developers, and what purpose planners had. For me, the QA job that requires these skills has come to me attractively, and I have an aspiration to work in the QA job. ""Power of positive mind: the ability not to be afraid of new knowledge and skills."" My strength is positive mind. These are the values I gained from my parents' teaching. This soon came to me as a new environment or positive recklessness in studying. I thought it was an essential competency in the IT job, where trends change day by day, and this mind gave me a good opportunity while majoring in SW. I have experience as an undergraduate intern at the Computer Vision Lab in order to study in a field I have not been on summer vacation in my third year. I had no knowledge of computer vision and told you that I wanted to visit the professor and learn, and as a result, I implemented the 'Poisson matting' thesis while working as an intern for two months. The thesis was implemented using OpenCV. This project was carried out by studying the basics of image processing after reading a thesis for the first time in my life. In fact, when I saw the result and held the final seminar in front of professors and students, I felt a great sense of pride. I used the computer vision knowledge I learned without stopping here in my project. While producing ""MakeApp"" for the ""Software Engineering"" class, I shared my computer vision knowledge with my team members and used Face Recognition and Aging Algorithm while producing a matching application for missing children as a graduation project. Through this, I was able to learn that diverse experiences and knowledge can be the source of ideas for new projects. ""Dance: Leadership and perseverance."" I like to dance. Since high school, I have performed at festivals and worked in a dance club in college. The dance club, which entered the third grade late, has influenced me a lot. It is a club that divides teams every quarter. When I first joined the club, I did not claim to be a leader. It is because I liked dancing, but I did not have the confidence to be good. However, while doing activities every quarter, I practiced individual and team practice by dividing my break time outside of studying time. As a result, there were members who looked at me with good eyes, and I was told that they always made it possible to do movements that were not possible in the previous practice in the next practice. Seeing those words and myself growing, I gained confidence and led the team by claiming to be the leader in the activities I conducted later. The biggest problem while leading the team was small talk and the team members' morale during practice. Since it was not a professional activity, the boundaries between personal conversations and opinions on dance were often broken. There were times when we only talked and the practice ended. So, I accurately conveyed to my team members the opinion to spend the 2 hours of comfortable practice, but properly practicing. In addition, it was common for team members' morale to decline as the practice period increased. To this end, I made a practice plan so that I would always set today's goals so that I would not be lazy in practice until the final stage. Through these efforts, the team members said that I let them know that the role of the leader is important in the dance club as well. It was a hobby, but I was always thinking, 'Once you started, let's do it properly.' In my personal hobby, I was able to find myself growing more confident in recognition of my leadership and tenacious efforts."
"""Data is the Competitiveness of Lotte Department Store"" As a statistics major, I had many opportunities to confirm that using data could effectively predict future outcome values. Naturally, I realized the importance of data-based decision-making, and I developed my statistical analysis capability by conducting big data analysis directly in projects and competitions in class. When I was exploring my career path, I also thought that I wanted to do something that produced meaningful results by deriving meaningful results from actual data. I think it is another opportunity now that all online commerce besides other department stores are competing with each other due to digitalization. Lotte Department Store has an overwhelming number of stores and customer data in the department store industry. The opportunity to obtain a variety of high-quality data by utilizing the time customers spend at department stores is open, and by using marketing that integrated data through omnichannel, I will gain unparalleled competitiveness. I applied because I wanted to use my statistical capabilities to gain marketing insights and create innovation with Lotte Department Store's data. ""Activity and challenging spirit nurtured in other countries"" I have established values that actively challenge myself from my childhood experience in the United States. When I was in the second grade of elementary school, I moved to the U.S. and entered a local school. I had a hard time adjusting because not only was there an Asian in the whole school, but I was not able to speak English at all. However, I first came forward, asked for help, and tried to speak to other friends in short English to learn English within a short period of a year. I made English my strength by taking advantage of the urgency of the situation that could have left me as a trauma, and now I have developed my skills enough to be mistaken for Korean by my foreign friends. Having crossed a big barrier in my childhood gave me the confidence to challenge myself without hesitation. I am often told by people around me that I am versatile. However, the truth is that rather than being outstanding, I bumped into various fields with the mind of 'Shouldn't I be persistent?' It was my first time to study finance, but with the will to learn, I obtained related certificates and worked at a financial engineering association. I had never dealt with Photoshop before, but I was in charge of producing posters for the association, and I made posters overnight through Photoshop while taking lectures. Based on my R and SAS coding skills, I also challenged programs such as Python and Excel VBA, conducted sessions, and used them for work. I booked a plane right away to learn Chinese and studied there alone for a month. In this way, you won't be afraid of challenges for innovation and ability improvement at work. ""Shortening work hours with coding capabilities"" When I was working as an intern at a life insurance company, I had the experience of saving time by organizing a simple program. At that time, I had no experience in practice and lacked financial knowledge. However, it was during the audit period, so it was difficult for department members to devote time to taking over. I found something I could actively do. One of the main tasks of the department was to find the payment capacity ratio, which required 1000 simulations to be rotated through VBA coding. It took about half a day for the existing code to run out, so I couldn't use the PC, and it was common for other departments working on related tasks to waste time waiting for the results. Interested in coding, I suggested that I would revise the code faster if you could help department members understand the simulation process. I was worried that my motivation to contribute would harm, but I worked with that much responsibility. With the help of department members, I studied the calculation process and studied VBA based on my R coding skills. For a week, I shortened the time by about four hours by changing the data into a matrix and modifying the code by using a loop statement. I greatly reduced working hours as I could check the simulation results when I needed them before leaving work without having to wait until the next day. I felt that I could make a practical contribution to the practice by actively utilizing what I learned at school. I learned that I could achieve better results through collaboration that demonstrated my individual capabilities, and I promised to be active in any organization. ""Winning a Big Data Analysis Contest with a Creative Approach"" In order to become a big data analysis expert, I learned how to access data through examples, and I gained experience by conducting analysis projects myself in classes and competitions. My strength is that I can understand the principles of analysis and take a creative approach. For male beauty marketing in the Big Data Analysis Competition, we analyzed the card and app usage history and survey results of 115,854 respondents with R and SAS. Each respondent should have expressed their interest in beauty, but at first, the number of items they use was used as a variable. However, this did not accurately reflect the difference between the items. Compared to men who use two basic products, skin lotion and sunscreen, men's interest in beauty is rather low. I came up with a new idea to score each item by assigning its frequency reciprocal as importance. Products that are frequently used gave low scores, and products that are not common, such as BB cream, gave high scores to measure the degree of interest in beauty. After that, we conducted a correlation analysis through pre-processing, and received the second prize in recognition of the performance and creativity of the model. In this way, I can achieve better results by trying various methods according to my intuition rather than inserting data into a fixed analysis frame. The weakness I have about my job is that the analysis tool I mainly use is limited to R. However, whenever I had the opportunity to overcome this, I used other programs such as Python and VBA, and I checked my ability to adapt quickly as needed. After joining the ""data expert that achieves innovation"", I will sincerely learn the marketing and sales strategy establishment process of Lotte Department Store and grow into a data expert.This is due to the fact that we need to know exactly how we are doing in order to drive progressive changes. By clustering customer data, we will anticipate the effectiveness or sales of promotions based on the business district, timing, and customer characteristics. I would also like to plan events and promotions with insights obtained by analyzing how consumption of a particular product tends to lead to other consumption. I would also like to challenge tweezers marketing that use customized events or discounts depending on the customer. In this way, we will strategically activate sales and confirm the results. After cultivating my expertise, I want to encourage customers to use online services at the same time and use department stores as a larger data platform to expand the scope of analysis. We will strengthen Lotte Department Store's position by innovative attempts that follow the trend of the times, such as conducting analysis using travel paths within department stores."
"When I was in college, I always led the team by taking on the team leader when I was working on team projects. It was possible because the team members highly appreciated my ability to take charge of the project with a responsibility, not because they wanted strong leadership and power. I did the project by listening to all the team members' opinions, drawing the best choice, and sharing the work according to each other's abilities through collaboration without falling out. Naturally, when I work on other projects, I take on the team leader, and the team leader has always been my role. I have experience as an assistant in a major course in team projects at the suggestion of the professor in the project class I took before. The assistant was a role in which all students had to work with fair principles and standards, and I tried to keep it and have faith in the students. In addition, I tried to become a friendly assistant who can approach students comfortably by asking questions about things they do not know, rather than a heavy position to assist the professor. With the above example, I want to become a talented person who shines in Dow technology. I believe that the value of a company is created by customers, and I believe that Dow technology, which provides technology development and services based on customer trust and approaches customers, is the ideal management method of the company. This was a big reason for me to choose Dow technology. As above, I chose a company with the goal of making a program that many people use comfortably and pleasantly. I want to be the best developer who provides the best services to customers with the flow of the process and the understanding learned while using financial programs. I want to work at Dow technology, which aims at customer trust and trust, as a talented person who shines the first step toward becoming the best developer. I have built up my competence to perform my duties with differentiated expertise by communicating with customers with trust with a customer-centered mind at Dow technology. As my project, I proceeded with a project to modify the school industry-academic management system site to meet the needs of users and add new functions. The project was carried out through communication with the team members who are working on the project together and through meetings with professors and students who are users. Although there were team members, they had different roles, so it was necessary to trust each other and proceed with different things. We tried to build trust through communication, let them know when there was something they didn't know, and build expertise as well. From the experience above, through meetings and communication, I developed the ability to draw and reflect active opinions for the development of the program, and I also improved my development capabilities such as JAVA and JSP. I want to contribute to the world with reliable technologies and services in Dow Technology by utilizing this strength. I have many acquaintances around me who invest in stocks through heroics, such as my parents and brothers. When we talk about investment, we also share our thoughts on the inconveniences or desired functions when using trading programs such as HTS and MTS. I wanted to create a better home trading program by addressing these customer requests. The owner of the program is the customer who is the user, and it should be provided so that all functions within the program can be easily and conveniently used. I applied to Dow Technology to become a solver in finding and solving improvement plans from the customer's point of view. I want to work in the financial development job within Dow Technology. OOOO provides customer autonomy and convenience through the Open API+ service. However, it is not easy for the general public to see and develop, so it shows that the program created by specific developers is purchased and used separately. The program should allow users to use all functions as easily and conveniently as possible. However, as mentioned earlier, the use of Open API+ services is difficult for most customers to use because there are many complicated parts. Therefore, I want to improve the functionality I want to use with just one touch. I am dreaming of my plan with the network carrier path. Currently, I have a dream to develop HTS and MTS for my financial IT work, but I want to find and develop a job that suits me the most and can function to me because the job I want may be different from the job I want."
"When I was a developer at OO, I was in charge of developing an integrated POS program for stores operated by the company. When I was working on the project, a total of three people, one senior developer and one designer, teamed up to carry out the project. Since it is a program operated by an actual store and it is difficult to make a program that recognizes and performs electronic devices such as a barcode reader and a printer, I decided that it would be better to produce it together. I had a meeting every morning after going to work to discuss the structure of the program, and discussed the composition and design of the page with the designer. The designer was in charge of simple front-end and design, and I was in charge of DB back-end and the rest of the front-end, and the senior developer was in charge of compatibility with external devices and back-end. As the systematic project progressed, the program was developed smoothly and distributed and used, but there were some problems in the actual use. ""Resolving the lack of reflection of user requirements"" Each user had a different language, and when using the function, it did not properly accommodate the user's needs, such as adding new functions that were different from what we thought and deleting unnecessary functions. So, I asked the store manager for help to accept the needs of program users and to gather opinions on what needs to be revised and what new functions they wanted and deliver them. His teamwork greatly helped him carry out the project. Whenever there was a change within the program, we held a meeting with the manager and produced the program through coordination so that users could use it as conveniently as possible. As a result, unnecessary modifications were noticeably reduced, and development progressed to meet the needs of users and showed great efficiency in usability. We distributed the ""automatic update through robot"" program and stored it in the headquarters database immediately when sales occurred in the store while in use. However, developers have to modify themselves because employees are inexperienced in using it or difficult for them to cope with new situations such as exchange and refund. So we created an additional deadline button to collectively transfer the database through the button at the end of the day, and added a bot program to automatically insert the data into the database after the deadline by creating a bot so that the staff could import the data even if they did not press the deadline button. I felt that collaboration with others was very important in this project, and I learned that coordination of disagreements with team members was also one of the great importance in the project's progress. I also learned that it was very important for customers who used the program, and I felt proud that it has established itself as a program that I still use today. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I had a hobby of getting information from various forum sites, doing business on exchanges frequently, and I wanted to create a site containing information on cryptocurrency and an automatic trading bot. So I set the goal of achieving these two projects and started the process. The trading site was made of JSP maven, and I received data using the public APIs of domestic and foreign exchanges, and put the data I needed while trading cryptocurrency, such as market price, exchange rate premium, and change, on the site. It was not difficult to create a web project, but there were many difficulties in creating an automatic trading bot. People create trading bots using the private API of the exchange called Binance, which is the most used in the world in cryptocurrency transactions, but it is difficult to obtain only the information they want because all the documents used are written in English and it is complicated, so I thought about whether they use other exchanges' APIs. However, since it is an exchange that I use and it is the most used by people, I have a strong will to create using the Binance API. So, I proceeded slowly with the development with help through mail with the developer of Binance and communication with other developers on Telegram. Eventually, I completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. What I was able to complete while working on the project was the result of constant communication. If I had looked for materials by myself, I could have quit because I was tired of difficulties, and I could have lost my will quickly because of the project I started voluntarily. However, I overcame difficulties through communication with others. Through this experience, I learned that constant passion and effort are not betrayed, and I want to prove and develop my work at Naver. People tend to use Google more often than Naver in search of the desired data. I also use Google a lot, and there are two main reasons. First, I felt that Google searched for related sites from various sites, but Naver brought in information that many people did not want, such as blogs and dictionary meanings, first. Second, information posts for commercial purposes are posted first on Naver. When you search for an item or product, advertising comes up through PowerLink, and components that lead to the sale of goods through Naver shopping are ranked high. The above two problems are good for commercial purposes, but I think the UI needs to be improved as Naver, which has the title of the best portal site in Korea. The main_pack within the search screen page is relatively narrow compared to sub_pack div, so there is no data under the search word ranking and news topic in sub_pack, but I thought it was inappropriate for space utilization as it remained empty. This is not a big problem due to external issues, but I wanted to correct it because it was inconvenient for customers using Naver sites."
"Kookmin Bank is my financial partner. I have been using Kookmin Bank for more than 10 years, starting with the first account opening. I also used a mobile bank that is easy to use with other banks, but the bank that has been with me so far is Kookmin Bank. As I used mobile banking and an application that is easy to operate, I felt strongly that Kookmin Bank prioritized customers. Also, I will now lead the way to provide customers with many services that I have received while looking at Kookmin Bank, which has set economic concepts and secured assets safely. During development, the most important thing is 'Can users use all services without difficulty while using the program?' As the purpose of the program is to provide convenient services to users, I try to make it comfortable and accessible. I will always put my customers first, thinking about how to get services more comfortable and trustworthy, and act. Many customers will come to companies that are working with customer priority in mind. I will try to make more and more customers use all of Kookmin Bank's services more conveniently. I got a working holiday visa and worked as a web full-stack developer in Germany. At this time, I was in charge of developing a POS program for stores operated by a company, and I played a role in adding and supplementing functions that users wanted or uncomfortable in the calculation program. The people who used the program were employees of the same company, but they were just like customers as they used my program. I received a lot of help in program production by adding additional functions that I sometimes request and supplementing them with feedback if there was any inconvenience in the functions I made. As I added new functions, I realized that sufficient conversation and feedback with users were important as I saw cases where functions made that I thought would be convenient for users to use caused inconvenience to users. In addition, it was very rewarding to fix their inconveniences with my hands and make them comfortable. I think the best customer service is by far constant customer communication. For example, let's say someone wants to start a stock business, and they want to start by watching a lecture from a paid stock trader. There will be many personal conditions in choosing a trader, but the most important of them is communication between the trader and the stock investor. Traders who always receive questions and opinions, even if they are a little lacking in skills, are more popular than traders who attract customers by telling them only when to buy or sell certain stocks. In the example above, the trader is Kookmin Bank, and the stock investor is the customer. Customers will always open their minds to a company that accepts their requests and solves problems quickly. The lack of communication lowers the customer's credibility and reduces access to the company. Another example is the KakaoTalk consultation service. In the past, most customer centers used to have inquiries through phone calls, visits, and e-mails. However, now most of them have KakaoTalk consultation services. The KakaoTalk consultation service has enabled many customers to make inquiries smoothly. There may also be many reasons for this, but the number one reason by far is fast and easy communication. The fact that inquiries can be received with just one message through KakaoTalk without the hassle of processing has come as a great advantage to customers, and KakaoTalk counseling service is establishing itself as a type of larger customer center as many customers are satisfied and using it. This is also a form of service that considers constant communication with customers, and communication with customers plays a big role in the image of the company. I always try to provide better services through constant communication with customers. When I was a web developer at a German company, I worked with other developers on a project to create a new company homepage. It was not a project that gave enough time to one person, but a project that consisted of two designers and two developers to complete in a short period of time, so it was a project that worried me a lot, which was relatively unskilled unlike other people. Since the project had to be completed in a given short time without any problems, everyone approached the project carefully and planned. We had a meeting every morning before starting work, shared our roles, shared each other's situations through messengers, and coded. First, we conceived the structure of the program and built the database, and the developers focused on the back-end. While joining the company and working as a web developer, I was only responsible for maintaining and repairing the programs I was using at the time, and I was nervous about starting a new project from scratch, and I made frequent mistakes, but I gained great experience and learned a lot from the project with the idea that everyone was not in a hurry and slowly worked from the basics. It was a project that was carried out by several people, but it was done in a way that each person developed their part separately, so I had to judge and develop the method of coding and the module of use. This personal judgment was given responsibility, but it was helpful for responsibility and self-development because we asked for opinions through communication with team members and conducted it by searching the Internet as much as possible. In addition, there were often times when opinions were divided at meetings with team members, but I also learned how to respect each other's thoughts, embrace each other, and lead the story so that I could achieve the best results. This project is the most memorable one, where I learned a strong confidence that I could complete all the future projects by completing a given big practical project safely for the first time, and I could feel the importance of teamwork with my whole body and learn open thinking through collecting opinions with my team members.I think the most important competency for bankers in response to the rapidly changing financial environment is to respond quickly. They pursue and advance fast and easy use, but as a side effect, there are many problems such as security and program errors. I cannot guarantee that all problems will be blocked at the source, but I think a quick response is always possible. When a problem occurs, first, a quick apology to customers, calmly identify the cause and solution of the problem, inform customers in a transparent manner, and respond quickly to the problem, which can be an opportunity to increase trust in customers. I think the most important competency for bankers is to respond quickly to crises. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency ""problem solving through quick response"". I created an automatic transaction bot using a homepage and a specific exchange API that informs the market price and information of cryptocurrency. There was a meeting where we shared information and talked while investing in cryptocurrency, and I shared that if anyone wanted to use the automatic transaction bot program I made on my own, even though I was not good enough, I would like to use it. While I was developing with opinions from people using my program, such as inconveniences and additional points, there was a time when the program failed due to changes in the API. If it was a program that I used alone and developed, there was no problem, but in fact, it was an important moment for other acquaintances to trade money, so a big problem could occur. However, once I learned that the problem had occurred, I quickly identified the problem and canceled the linked private API key of the users to block automatic transactions within the program, and solved the problem by modifying the program. It was a situation that could have caused a big problem, but as a result of responding calmly without panicking, I was able to solve the error without any problems. This experience made me feel the importance of quick response with my whole body, and I also learned that I had to take a great responsibility in developing as a program distributor."
"'Development Through Passion and Competition.' I liked to compete in good faith with my friends. Rather than developing without a goal, I enjoyed a simple bet with my friends, or a sense of accomplishment when I set a goal to be the first place and paid off. Even if it is not always about studying, I have developed by enjoying competition even when playing games or exercising. I acted with the idea of setting goals and improving myself, not being determined to beat others. Also, it became an opportunity for me to passionately focus on something. The above sentence, 'It is better to regret after doing it than not doing it and regretting it' is my motto. I have always lived in a challenging attitude based on my motto. Due to my timid personality when I was a child, I often overstepped without even challenging many things I wanted to do. As I grew up, I decided to change my personality thinking that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would not be able to do anything, so I tried to live a positive and challenging life. I have used small payments a lot while using the Internet. Many people, not just me, have used the multi-day micropayment system and I still continue to use it. People recognize and do not use the payment system as a 'multi-day' system, but they are all familiar with it. This has given me a passion to work in multiple days. I wanted to develop a system that many people unconsciously use comfortably, rather than being rewarded with doing tasks that others know. My value as a developer is to create a program that many people use easily and conveniently. I want to develop it by thinking from the user's point of view how our program users can use our services faster and more easily. I applied because I wanted to realize this dream in multiple days. I am confident in web programming. When I was in college, I started making a basic homepage using HTML, and I dreamed of becoming a web programmer while learning JSP. However, I went to Germany for a working holiday to experience as a developer because I thought that theoretical classes and simple projects taught in school could not build my skills. When I was a developer in Germany, I was in charge of maintenance of the company's homepage written in JSP. Developing additional function pages and improving design The front-end was mainly developed to enhance the development capability of becoming a web developer. In addition, we carried out a project to develop an integrated POS program for stores operated by the company using the PHP Laravel framework. Although I did not have much experience in the PHP language, I was in charge of the task because it was not much different from the JSP I was confident in, and there were not many differences in the development languages such as JAVASCRIPT and HTML. As a different experience, I worked on the maintenance of the school website. I improved my ability to understand the code by looking at the code written by all developers, and by adding new functions and correcting errors. Through communication with the team members who are working on the project together and through meetings and meetings with professors and students who are users, we improved our ability to proceed with the project. This became an opportunity to increase the sense of responsibility for the development program and the creativity and conductivity of adding functions. In addition, I improved the efficiency of the project by writing a guide document for the developer who will be in charge of me next. Of course, it was difficult to skillfully solve all the tasks in both experiences, but I improved my skills by studying separately after work. Through the above experience, I have improved my web development capabilities. There are two main dreams and goals I want to pursue in Danal. The development of a cryptocurrency called Paycoin led the practical cryptocurrency market to enable payment as well as in-kind through the development of a cryptocurrency called Paycoin. For people who previously thought cryptocurrency was just speculation, the start of Danal's blockchain business showed the possibility that cryptocurrency can be applied to real life and open up a faster and more convenient payment system than today. I want to continue my challenge and work on blockchain. With interest in blockchain, I wanted to study cryptocurrency-related research, write a paper through specific cryptocurrency research, create an automatic trading bot through the API of the Binance exchange, and later work on blockchain-related work. The achievement I am trying to show is to change the perception of cryptocurrency and instill in people that it is the introduction of technology that is far faster and more convenient than the existing payment system. I want to let you feel that it is a technological advancement, not a temporary speculation like Bubble Dotcom. Small payment services are every day. Many people have used the Internet or mobile phone micropayments, but many people do not know that the company of the service they used is every day. I want to instill an awareness that these people's perceptions are convenient and easy because they are not just a means of paying, but they are also provided by Multiple. Technology is very important, but promoting it is also a very important role in the development of the company. Danal is moving toward the role of financial institutions by expanding the credit rating business using big data. Regarding the big data analysis and credit rating business, I want to show results in creating a reliable company that pays with trust because people use multiple payment systems to pay while using multiple systems. I will grow as a communicative developer. I will be a developer who communicates and grows with my team members, not just a developer who has improved development capabilities. Good ideas and creativity are not derived only from the competence of a specific person. I come up with creative and innovative ideas after a lot of people put their heads together and think. I'm not a person who is proud of my development capabilities, but I'm trying to be a developer who is humble to myself and collects other people's opinions to provide the best service to customers who use the service every day.The constant communication and development between developers through code review will serve as an opportunity for both me and my team members to grow, and I will become a person who actively utilizes this culture to grow. Also, the person who uses our service is the customer. The element that makes a company will be a developer who develops into a service that customers want by focusing on the customer's sound, focusing on the idea of customers. I will become a person who develops through communication with customers and communication with team members."

Due to my timid personality as a child, I often overstepped without even challenging many things I wanted to do. However, as I grew up, I thought that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would not be able to do anything, so I decided to change my personality and tried to live a positive and challenging life. I have also always lived in a challenging attitude based on my motto. There were many challenges, and I would like to talk about myself through two of them. ""Don't let it work."" I had a tablet, which did not support versions 2.3 or later through OS upgrades. Later on, April 4.When version 0 came out, I wanted to use the new version, but I thought buying a new tablet was the only way to use it, so I searched the Internet to see if there was any other way. At that time, I saw an article that the 4.0 version can be used with my Galaxy Tab if I distribute version 4.0 within an Internet cafe and manually update it through loading. Although loading was not illegal, I realized that A/S support was not possible after proceeding with loading, but I thought it would be necessary to improve the speed, so I put it into action. ""Can I do well? Let's try it first."" When I was in college, I received excellent grades in programming language subjects such as C and JAVA, but I wanted to experience practice because I thought it would be difficult to strengthen my programming skills with theories and small projects learned at school. I was issued a working holiday visa in Germany and joined the company as a web developer of a logistics company in Frankfurt through a job site. It was not easy to work abroad due to my lack of experience and living abroad, but my biggest decision to come to Germany was the will to return with a lot of experience and learning. Challenging anything is not always the right attitude. My disadvantage is that I am impatient and start with overflowing passion without being fully prepared, and sometimes fail. However, I am doing everything with my motto, ""It's better to do it and regret than not regret it"" and passion and spirit to do things that may be impossible and adversely affect me. My strengths and weaknesses are haste, which is the back of passion and spirit, just like cause and effect. However, I try to become a person who hides darkness by reducing haste, which is my weakness, by adding constant effort and passion. Through the experience below, I would like to tell you about how I turned failure into success with my efforts and passion. I was interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency technology, so I studied and invested. At that time, there were often users who used automatic transaction programs, but I also wanted to create an automatic transaction bot. The automatic trading bot was created using the private API of the exchange called Binance, which has the highest volume in the world, and I thought it was difficult to obtain only the information I wanted due to the complicated usage documents, but I was strongly willing to create it using the Binance API in that it is an exchange I use and an exchange that people use the most. So I proceeded with the development with help through mail with the developer of Binance and communication with other developers on Telegram. Eventually, I completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. This experience gave me confidence that if I work without giving up with persistence, I can solve difficult tasks, and I gained courage to overcome without worrying about future tasks. A life of complacency has not progressed. I have tried, challenged, and improved for a better life than now. Although the major classes I learned in school did not do well, I thought I could not express myself with simple numbers, so I made it important to make and experience it myself. ""Conflict? Is there anything you need to understand, be considerate, and coordinate your opinions?"" Looking at the friends around you who are in a relationship, the reason for the breakup was ""we are not compatible."" It is perfectly natural, and it is a cowardly excuse. We all have different thoughts, habits, and personalities. It is only natural that two people are not compatible. You should acknowledge the differences, respect each other, and show understanding and deal with them. I have no experience in fighting with a lover so far. First, I provide information to get to know me, such as my lifestyle habits and actions, and listen to the other person's opinions and their lives as well. Also, I try to coordinate the differences and dislike parts. You may think it is very ideal behavior and nonsense, but I have lived like it until now and will continue to do so. It is the same with friends and co-workers. Instead of concluding that ""That person doesn't fit me, we can't get along,"" we should meet with a mutual understanding and respect. However, even if we know each other well, a conflict can happen at any time. When a conflict arises, I first listen to the other person's thoughts, identify and understand what caused the problem with me. And I solve the problem by talking with the other person. Also, when there is a conflict of opinion, I like to take time to appeal each other's opinions and discuss them with better opinions. My goal in life is to become a developer who can confidently answer the question 'What did you do?' when someone asks you in the future, 'I created and still use these programs.' With the idea that tigers die and leave leather, developers die and leave programs, KB Kookmin Card is about to take the step toward becoming the best developers."
"I want to work on developing Shinsegae I&C's overall distribution system and POS system. I tried to use it a few times because I could easily see unmanned devices around me, but it was difficult to use it due to different UI and uncomfortable UX for each POS device. Shinsegae I&C is striving for convenient payment in stores through the development and introduction of deep learning-based artificial intelligence and cloud-based POS. My goal as a developer is to create a program that people can use easily and conveniently. Shinsegae I&C's goal of striving to develop a payment culture through SSG Pay was consistent with my goal and supported. I have tried to become a well-understood developer who can quickly input Shinsegae I&C's S/W job through the development of POS systems and learning the structure of logistics systems. I want to have an opportunity to grow by looking at places like Shinsegae I&C that are running toward the happiness and convenience of customers by becoming a talented person who shines on Shinsegae I&C with a passionate and overcoming difficulties. I want to play a role in developing and operating POS systems. When I was an intern, I was working on a POS system development project and my relationship with POS began. This experience is a differentiated ability and experience that I can do better than others in itself, and I would like to talk about it. The project I was in charge of was to develop an integrated POS system for stores run by a company. A total of three people, including a designer who can develop a little front-end, another developer who is in charge of compatibility with external devices such as a printer, a barcode reader, and the rest of the front, end, and DB, were in charge of the project. It was created with the PHP Laravel framework, and the development tool was jointly developed through ATOM and Github. All sales data are stored in the company's integrated DB, so first, a POS system with a basic framework that can be used in all stores was developed, and then UI/UX changes and accounting logic were implemented and introduced according to the style of each store. In the above development method, a system was established so that it could be used immediately when a new store opens, enabling rapid development. In addition, a bot program was created separately and automatically stored in the headquarters DB and the local DB according to the set time and the amount of processed data to prevent data loss. With the development capabilities and customer-centered minds gained from the above experience, I will skillfully perform the tasks that Shinsegae I&C will take on in the future. I was very interested in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I had a hobby of obtaining information from various forum sites and trading on exchanges, and I wanted to create a site containing information on cryptocurrency and an automatic transaction bot. So I set the goal of achieving these two projects and started the process. The site was written in JSP through the maven framework. It could have been made simple by using the template, but I wanted to make it all with my own strength, so I made all the designs myself. In addition, I made it by considering the structure of MVC and the operation of an optimized homepage. I received data through public APIs of domestic and foreign exchanges, and included the data I needed while trading, such as market prices, exchange rate premiums, and changes, on the site. It was easy to create the web, but creating automatic trading bots had many difficulties. I created a trading bot using the private API of an exchange called Binance, but it was difficult to obtain only the information I wanted because the API usage documents were complicated. However, I wanted to create it using the Binance API because it is an exchange that people use the most and I use. So, first, we built the necessary dependencies through API information, and developed it with help through e-mail with Binance developers and communication with developers on social media. Eventually, we completed creating a bot that allows designated and market prices to buy and sell over a month. I think it was possible to complete the project thanks to constant communication. If I had looked for materials by myself, I could have quit after getting tired of the difficulties, and my will could have quickly disappeared due to the project I started voluntarily. However, I have overcome difficulties through communication with others. Through this experience, I learned that constant passion and effort do not betray, and I also want to prove and develop my work at Shinsegae I&C with passion."
"Watching the personal information leakage incident at domestic telecommunication companies and credit card companies a few years ago, I was amazed that such large companies also leak information, but I felt a lot of inconvenience due to the large amount of spam texts. Also, while implementing the user management system using the database and the access control system according to the user in the OO education center, I came to feel the importance of the security system that I took for granted. If I become a member of a AhnLab, I collect information on places where the user's personal information is registered and make a list to manage the advertisement and service reception of each site. Even if personal information is leaked from somewhere else, I want to become a security developer who can block spam text messages or emails from places that the user has never signed up or visited before and track where the information was leaked from. Recently, seven companies, including the three mobile telecommunication companies and Samsung Electronics, have developed mobile certificate apps based on blockchain. The goal of this application is to submit graduation and transcripts, and to make it easy to authenticate anywhere through a smartphone without having to carry a student or ID card. In an era where everything is smart, this technology will provide convenience to many people, but it will require much stronger security because the application contains all kinds of personal information of users. It would be more effective if it was based on a private blockchain in which only certain organizations or individuals can participate, but I think additional security solutions are needed. Also, even if a specific certificate is issued through the application, it is not stored directly in a smartphone, but if it is a method that requires a company's server to request it every time when using or transmitting it, and undergo personal authentication every time, such as an official certificate, I think the approval system between companies will become complicated. When I was in my fourth year of college, I participated in an M2M competition with my friends under the theme of Electronic Arms with Four Functions. The problem occurred on the day of the evaluation. While I was going to the evaluation site to finish setting up and testing, the board burned down due to a new motor drive, so I couldn't replace it with the existing one. Since we didn't have an extra board, we prepared for the evaluation by taking measures to demonstrate without a board through an emergency meeting. Although I couldn't show direct action, one of my team members faithfully explained the hardware, and I, as a software representative, explained the operation structure by code, and finished the demonstration safely by showing the demonstration video of the project, which was the motif of the electronic artificial hand, and the test video taken by the other team members. As a result, even though I didn't show my movements, I received a pretty good evaluation and was able to win the Encouragement Award. Through this experience, I have come to realize the importance of teamwork, the extra materials, and the need for demonstration videos. ""Successful human relationships."" I think I have been good at human relationships. Due to my introverted personality during my school days, I became a habit of caring for others, and as many people consider me well, I have become close to various people through clubs and student meetings, and I have maintained a continuous relationship. ""Teamwork master"" I have never had anyone leave or have a disagreement in the group activities so far. Although I have been in charge of SW development in the project, I have actively accepted the opinions of the team members, and I approached the team members first so that they could get acquainted quickly in the group project, and I was able to do well without anyone getting in a free ride by leading the distribution of roles and meetings first. ""Multilateral Knowledge"" I have laid the foundation for IT-related knowledge from hardware to software to programming through my college curriculum, and I have expanded my expertise by learning web programming, Android, and DBMS through my professional curriculum. I think this accumulated knowledge will be of great help in creating various security systems."
"""Growing Up: The Responsibility I Learned by Regret and Reflection."" After graduating from high school, my father faced me and said, ""You are now an adult, so you have to take responsibility for what you have done. I won't say much if you marry tomorrow."" At that time, I thought lightly about and passed on the responsibilities my father was talking about, but there were so many opportunities to rethink them. The problems that occurred due to short thoughts and irresponsibility such as part-time jobs and group assignments were never trivial and made me look back on myself. However, as someone said that you only grow up after entering the military, community life in the military became an opportunity to correct wrongs before. After being discharged from the military, I returned to college by acting responsibly for my job, changing the perspective of my surroundings, and getting an opportunity to work as an assistant in the professor's class or be recommended as an assistant in a department facility. Through these experiences, I will responsibly complete the given task by dedicating myself. When you proceed with your task of ""Personality: Being meticulous,"" you proceed systematically through plans. When I was in charge of the department's facility assistant and managed the equipment, I didn't receive the transfer before, so I started with arranging the warehouse. I attached a cycle for each equipment, organized the items by year, and then documented and managed them. Through this, I was able to manage the equipment for a year without any minor loss of it, and I was able to proceed with the transition without any problems. In this way, I will make a plan for my task, manage it systematically, and show you how I can trust and entrust it. I am timid in terms of ""personality disadvantages: introverted"" interpersonal relationships. If there is a mistake in speaking or something I feel sorry about, the other person's feelings are bothered for a long time. I think it's a disadvantage because excessive worry can cause damage to people around me. In order to solve this problem, I am trying to solve it by telling the other person my concerns and apologizing once again. ""Hobby Activities: Games"" I like to enjoy and analyze games created by the imagination of various people. I like to participate in alpha and beta testers, share information with people, suggest corrections, and enjoy hunting together as a group, such as raid. Perhaps because of this experience, I prefer SRPG, strategy, and RPG games with high degree of freedom. As a graduation work of ""Hotion Recognition Video Call"", a project to transmit emoticons by combining a Leap Motion sensor and a video call was carried out. The goal was to recognize specific finger motions using Leap Motion and to display the designated object on the screen. The main development tools used were Unity 3D, Mono Development, Eclipse, MySQL, and C# and Java. To represent the designated object on the screen, the Leap Motion sensor was linked using Unity 3D and C#, and the video call was implemented using DB interworking and socket communication using Java in Eclipse. However, it was not easy to complete such a project. In the existing initial setting, Leap Motion was to be drawn and transmitted by hand on a drawing board in conjunction with Java to reduce the development tools, but it was changed to C# to improve the visual part of Demo, and the UI was also modified from Java Swing to FX. Although we had to proceed with the new implementation as the design direction changed during the implementation, we were able to build a development environment comfortably based on the data we researched in advance. In addition, the success of the project was due to the experience of closely examining APIs and being able to access them easily even if the language changes. The most important thing I felt while working on a project like this was the importance of the initial design. As the old saying goes, we will be a person who prepares to respond calmly even if it occurs, so that there are no sudden changes in the project."
"""Shinhan DS, a company that meets my standards."" When I choose a company, I see stability and job suitability. I thought that Shinhan DS is the most stable as it belongs to Shinhan Financial Group, a well-known group in Korea. I have decided to apply for the job because I think that the hacking response field among Shinhan DS's information protection projects is appropriate for my ability in the field of analysis of vulnerabilities, penetration tests, security solutions, reverse engineering, and forensics. ""Information security expert recognized by everyone"" My goal after joining the company is to become an information security expert recognized by everyone within three years. To do so, I will make the following efforts. First, I will quickly grasp the relevant job and focus on performance and communication with my team members. From what I have experienced so far, I think it is most efficient to perform tasks through teamwork rather than performing tasks by individuals. Therefore, I will ensure that the organizations harmonize well and always be receptive so that they can adapt quickly. Second, I will acquire a certificate. I will acquire an information security technician, CCNA, etc. Information security is a job that requires not only practical skills but also knowledge of the law, and is capable of quick response and prevention in emergency situations, so we will strive for more and more self-development. As described above, we will become an information security expert who can develop and expand our capabilities with Shinhan DS. 1. Blog address: https://blog.naver.com/OOOO Blog summarized basic information about C language, network, and Linux, and organized about reverse engineering and forensics using Immunity Debugger. Currently, we are working on a program that has similar functions to PEVIEW, a tool that shows the PE structure of the program, using C++. 2. Using reverse engineering tools IDA, Process Monitor, and Bintext, we analyzed the 3.20 virus that paralyzed major networks in Korea on March 20, 2013 and checked the functions used. In addition, we analyzed Lena Reversing Tutorial to improve reverse engineering capabilities. 3. Using FTK Image and Autopsy, we forensics the permanently deleted program through shift+delete. 4. As a graduation work, we implemented IoT smart door using Raspberry Pi. C#, Raspberry Pi 3, Arduino, MJPG-Streamer, and WiFi are used to operate the webcam through source code, and Arduino is implemented to control sound detection sensor, tact switch sensor, and servo motor. And we implemented a function to control Raspberry Pi and Arduino with a serial port using the C# language, and an automatic text messaging function. ""Successful orientation performance by communicating with team members"" We formed a team and prepared it for the orientation band club performance for freshmen in February 2017. However, even though the team members had two weeks of individual practice, they did not practice their songs properly, so they kept making mistakes and missed the beat during the ensemble. We have a performance in two weeks, but we thought that we would be laughed at in front of new students, so we suggested buying food and sharing our opinions with our team members. When I listened to the team member's opinion, I answered that I could do it because the song seemed easy at first, but when I tried to practice, the beat was difficult, so I didn't dare to practice. However, I couldn't tell you because I thought changing the song would damage the team because it was a song I decided after consulting with the team members. After hearing the team member's situation, I gave feedback that they would understand if I told the other team members, and suggested that we set a table with the team members to coordinate our opinions. As a result of talking with the team members, the team members also understood the situation of the conflicted team member, and agreed to practice after selecting a new song that new students would like. And the team members who had conflict practiced even harder, saying they were sorry to change the song because of themselves. As a result, our team successfully wrapped up the performance on the day of orientation and received the greatest cheers during the performance. In order to join Shinhan DS, ""the dream of a security expert who built a security solution,"" I developed the ability of security experts by receiving practical training. So, when I deliberately took the lecture, I listened with more interest in building a security solution. In order to strengthen my skills, I aimed to win the best project award and challenged to build an OOOO security solution. After designing the project, there was a problem. In order to build a security solution, it was necessary to check where the vulnerabilities were, but all of the team members had difficulty because they had not studied about identifying them. So, I gained knowledge by studying with the team members through internet search and questions to the instructor. After that, I divided each part into responsibilities of analyzing vulnerabilities, performing penetration tests, and building security solutions. I asked the instructor about how to analyze various vulnerabilities and how to test penetration, and solved them by referring to the community. Since then, in order to find complement points and to complete a better project, we have improved penetration tests and security solutions with the instructor. All of the team members constantly worked on their part and performed faithfully. As a result, we received the Best Project award in the project presentation. In order to protect the information of the ""Backdoor production experience"", I thought that we should first try the penetration test, which is the opposite nature, so I proceeded with the project of practical training and created the Backdoor by myself. I have experience in creating chat programs using C++ language and socket programming, and I came up with the idea that I could create a backdoor program using this socket programming.The Backdoor program consists of Backdoor_Server and Backdoor_Client. After installing Backdoor_Server on the victim's PC through MetaSploit, the security center notification function on the victim's PC was switched to 'off' when running, so that it does not display the message that the firewall has been released when the firewall is released, and the function that runs automatically when the system starts by registering in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Windows\CurrentVersion\run in regit. And I opened UDP port 533 and made the backdoor_Client wait for the connection. When the backdoor_Client accesses, we created a backdoor that can remotely control the Backdoor_Server installed on the victim's PC with preset commands, ps, dir, get, put, kill, del, cmd, shutdown, and destroy."
"When persuading the other person, I listen to the other person's opinion and think about the situation to persuade them. In February 2017, a team was formed of vocals, guitar, bass, and drums for a college freshman orientation club performance, and a team member who had conflict was in charge of the drum part. We set the ensemble period for one month, and we decided to meet three days a week from four weeks before the performance, and then started practicing. However, it made me and the other team members feel bad because the ensemble itself was impossible because the team member kept making mistakes because he did not practice, and he couldn't match the beat. In order to solve this situation, I bought a meal to a team member and shared opinions, and as a result, I decided to choose a new song, and I practiced hard to show the best performance among orientation performances. Information is collected through questions from the Internet, books, and instructors. An example is the experience of producing a backdoor program. The file consists of Backdoor_Server and Backdoor_Client. After secretly installing Backdoor_Server on the victim's PC, the security center notification function on the victim's PC was switched to 'off' when running, so it does not show the message that the firewall has been released when the firewall is released, and the function that runs automatically when the system starts by registering in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\run is implemented. And I left UDP port 533 open and waited for the connection of Backdoor_Client. When Backdoor_Client accesses, it remotely controls Backdoor_Server with preset commands. The commands were ps, dir, get, put, kill, cmd, shutdown, and destroy. As the president of the club, I wanted to give the members a chance to perform in addition to regular performances, so I prepared a separate performance plan, but the performance plan was disrupted in the middle of the way due to insufficient budget of the club. In order to solve this problem, I asked the seniors in the club, who have been close since they were freshmen, about their willingness to support the performance fee, and they gladly supported me, saying, 'This is nothing for the juniors'. When the budget was met, there was no obstacle to finding a place, and an overall plan was established such as selecting a performance team and selecting a performance song. In addition, I gave feedback from time to time when practicing the performance team, and I tried to show a high-quality performance. As a result, I was able to successfully conclude the performance I planned. Through this experience, I knew that it would be helpful one day if I built up human relationships well on a regular basis, and that if I tried to get closer to the other person, I could get close quickly, and I am trying to become a social person. Through internet search and questions to the instructor, I gained knowledge by studying with my team members. After that, they divided each part and took charge of analyzing vulnerabilities, performing penetration tests, and building security solutions. I asked the instructor about the method of analyzing various vulnerabilities and the penetration test method, and I solved it by referring to the community. After analyzing vulnerabilities using OpenVAS, nmap, we built security solutions using SQL Injection, XSS, CVE vulnerability attacks, SSL Stripes, Backdoor, Linux Kernel privileges increase, password cracking, IPS/IDS, firewall, special character protection script, encryption, salt value application, etc., and we improved penetration tests and security solutions with the instructor to complete better projects. All of the team members worked tirelessly on their part and faithfully performed it. As a result, we won the Best Project Award in the project presentation. When I was a junior at university, I had a team project. It was a project that was made on a free subject using Arduino kits, and other teams said they would purchase the project from the project agency site to get an A+. Our team members also asked us to purchase the project, but the professor asked us to do it creatively and not purchase it, so we decided to make it on our own. The team members said it was not good because they thought the quality would be inferior to other teams, but I convinced them that they would have to follow the rules so that they wouldn't be stabbed in conscience when submitting the project, and the team members eventually agreed. As a result of a lot of hard work, the results began to appear one by one, and we completed satisfactory results. I have experience in analyzing the 3.20 virus that paralyzed major networks in Korea on March 20, 2013, using IDA, Process Monitor, and Bintext, and checking the functions used. When analyzing malicious code, I analyzed it using VMWare because there was a possibility that the computer could be infected, but at first, I analyzed it with the Immunity Debugger, and the virus was automatically executed and the OS was destroyed. Therefore, after analysis using IDA, a static reverting program, we used Process Monitor to check the process of generating, writing, and reading when the virus was working, and using Bintext to check the functions used in the virus. According to the analysis, the 3.20 virus destroyed the OS by loading the library required by the malware, forcibly shutting down the process using the Taskkill command, overwriting certain strings in the partition table, and executing the reboot command shutdown -r -t 0."
"Like M2M mentioned in the past, IoT is changing to not just collecting or exchanging data, but also to analyzing it to create new values. I was interested in an IoT platform such as Tinkerbell operated by Lotte Information and Communication because it conducts all the processes such as connecting objects, collecting, storing, and analyzing data to build an IoT environment. In order to develop and operate such an IoT platform, I have studied various machine learning algorithms including deep learning while attending school, and have studied low-speed, low-cost, and low-power networks that are advantageous for collecting data such as LoRa and long-distance communication. I want to contribute to the development and development of Lotte information and communication's IoT platform based on the knowledge I have studied so far. As a liberal arts student until I graduated from high school, I was a student in the case of going to university through cross-application. I had a great difficulty following the university subjects because I did not learn science subjects while in high school. Eventually, I joined the military and even thought of changing my career to drop out, transfer, or transfer after discharge. However, shortly after being discharged from the military, I learned an anecdote about the construction of Pohang Steel, by a man named Park Tae-joon, by chance. In the meantime, I thought I had simply built a factory, but this was wrong. I was able to build a comprehensive steel mill that seemed difficult due to the will to persuade Japanese companies to obtain capital and technology and the principle of not tolerating a little insolvency. After learning about Chairman Park Tae-joon's anecdote, I thought that I just wanted to run away. I thought about the best way to improve my capabilities, and I felt the need to do things that others are not good at. And although the ability to utilize Linux is a quality that must be acquired, it was appropriate because it was not approached by many students due to vague difficulties. There were many moments when I wanted to give up, but I did not give up one by one and took the courage to challenge myself. As a result, no one in my colleagues was able to handle Linux as much as I was, and my ability, which was behind before joining the military, was ahead of others. As a result, I gained personal honor, recognition from people around me, and confidence that I could do anything, such as receiving the top prize in a software engineering competition. With such a challenging spirit, I want to pursue my ambition by becoming a talented person in Lotte Information and Communication. I was selected for the K-SW Square organized by the IITP and had the opportunity to stay at Purdue University in Indiana for about four months. For me, who had never been abroad for a long time and had never been to the U.S., it was an important experience to be able to experience and understand American culture while working on a project with Purdue University students. For example, while watching soccer and baseball games with Purdue University students, I learned about the differences between American society and our society. We used to listen to different electoral systems, relationships, drinking culture, etc., and tell stories about Korea, and were surprised by the differences. However, the most memorable thing was the way they handled work. As I had to share the work while working on the project, I asked the American student to write the RSA module. He said he would do it, but a few days later he failed to develop it. When I asked him what happened, he said, ""I tried, and I failed. Now it's time to try in a different way. If I fail again, I'll just try again."" For a while, I fell into mannerism and rejected the possibility of failure even when I was working because I was afraid of failure. However, once I heard that, I learned again that it is important to challenge anything. With this mindset, I want to become an engineer who produces results with an invincible spirit of challenge in Lotte Information and Communication. I worked on a team project in a software engineering course, and the goal was to develop an Android app for carpooling with my team members. For the development, we decided to build a server remotely, and I was the only one who could handle Linux, so I was in charge of the backend and server construction, and the rest of the team members divided up to develop Android apps. I've dealt with Linux, but I've never created a web server, and making Android accessible to a remote server was not easy. Nothing was easy, installing the necessary packages, dependence between packages, setting up networks such as IP, and managing firewalls, but I worked hard to solve them one by one with the encouragement of my team members and the bond with them. Programming web servers also took time to develop, focusing on understanding grammar and operation structure. And through frequent communication with colleagues, we made an appointment between Android and web servers to increase development completion and won the top prize. Through the whole process, I gained great experience in building Linux servers and developing the backend of the web or apps, and later, I was able to strengthen my capabilities to the point where I could earn living expenses through outsourced development. However, I am constantly reducing it, but my regret is that I sometimes do not check documents or completeness because I am in a hurry when introducing new libraries or packages. If not carefully introduced, I have to take time to solve new problems caused by the package after introduction, so I am paying more attention to development these days. The era of 5G will soon arrive, which means that it will change the world, not just speed up communication. However, it is not only about speed changing the world, but also about speed reducing latency to 1 millisecond and speeding up responses. If 5G is introduced in earnest and delays are minimized, the data collected from the sensor will be immediately delivered to the trained machine learning program to perform classification, etc., and to quickly transmit results.In other words, it is possible to receive, analyze, and respond immediately by receiving the customer's situation. To this end, I will adapt to the company at the near distance and learn my work, and Lotte will lead the changed world in the 5G era by developing machine learning capabilities, including deep learning, in the far distance."
"""Route search implementation with heuristic"" While studying artificial intelligence, the path search algorithm became very interested in A*, and I challenged to implement the algorithm that improved Theta* by looking for papers on D* and Theta*, etc. A* and Theta*, which are mainly used, were compared, and the development was carried out from early 2018 to December 2019 with the aim of searching a convenient path from a human perspective, not an optimal path for movement. A*, Theta* algorithm was implemented based on the pseudo-code described in the paper. The program was written based on C++, but data structures such as Queue, Stack, and Sort were directly implemented and used without an algorithm header file. A map similar to the actual road was produced using an array, and the result value was derived by changing the road conditions (traffic, accidents, etc.). Through this, we received the excellent thesis award at OOOOO 2018, improved it, and submitted it as a dissertation. After entering the graduate school of ""practice assistant"", I conducted electric and electronic basics, logic circuits, microprocessors, embedded systems, and IoT practice assistant from the 2nd semester of 2017 to 2018. In the electrical and electronic basics, basic elements such as capacitors, transistors, and thermistors were studied, and in the logic circuit, the understanding of logic gates was improved by using simulators such as Verilog and LogicWorks. The microprocessor operated the sensor through the Z-80 assembly and implemented device drivers in the embedded system. In the IoT class, a project focused on object recognition by incorporating OpenCV into Raspberry Pi was carried out with students. ""3D Printer Data Collection"" From April to December 2017, the operating environment and power consumption according to movement of 3D printers were measured using LabView. In an environment such as Korea, power consumption of 3D printers is not a big problem, but it was thought that optimization of power consumption in an environment such as Southeast Asia where factories are established and operate on a large scale was meaningful. By analyzing the G-code, various operations in which the X, Y, and Z axes are the reference were programmed, and power consumption was measured by converting the ambient temperature. I tried to derive the results and write them as a paper, but a similar paper was published at the end of 2017, so the experiment was stopped. ""Indoor positioning using UWB"" I have participated in an indoor positioning study conducted by OO University's network laboratory from April to December 2018. It was a study on indoor positioning using tags and anchors in factories using UWB modules. We implemented an application that fetches Anchor's value stored in the DB, represents it on a map, calculates the value of the tag, and outputs it on the screen in real time. It was produced using Android Studio, and it was changed to a format that fetches the location from the web server due to the loading of the built-in image and the problem of location mapping during the project. After that, in order to analyze the reliability according to the remaining battery capacity of the tag and Anchor, to understand the relationship between the reception speed and location, the experiment was conducted in a place with little interference, and the values accumulated in the DB were analyzed in a graph format using Excel, and the relationship was identified. ""Participation Project"" From September to November 2018, I participated in and completed the 2018 Regional Company Difficulties Solving Competition. We have developed focusing on object search with OOOOOO companies. On Linux, object search was conducted using Google-cloud-vision and OpenCV using C language, but it did not achieve much success. I participated in the industry-academic linkage project organized by OOOOO Bank from July to November 2018. Based on Java, a bank service chatbot based on natural language processing was created using OOO, OOOOOO API and AWS, but it did not win the prize. ""Development of personal & & corporate customized management service"" As I learned computer science, I have realized the importance of existing programs and algorithms when participating in projects or developments. Therefore, at first, I want to improve my overall understanding of the job by grasping the internal implementation and algorithms of programs used by companies such as Lockin'Body Serise. If you are ready to participate in the development after that, I would like to participate in BLE communication between devices or middleware development that can be linked to existing programs so that I can provide personalized health care services by converging in-body, wearable devices, and apps. If the job is recognized through such development, I would like to challenge wearable healthcare products through the task system. Using 5G's large-capacity streaming characteristics, I would like to aim to develop an InBody product that can transmit and receive entire body information in real time and allow customers to check the status with images through applications, AR, and VR. Of course, at the time when 5G is used, it may be absurd and lacking in technology. However, my goal is to develop and provide a wonderful product that can be easily checked with the health of the family at home."
"""Growing Up Through Competition"" Since childhood, I have been an ordinary child who has nothing better than others. For that reason, I had a high sense of competition toward my friends while comparing myself to others. I felt that if someone does something, I can do it, so I had to challenge myself to make it work. The first thing that started was a competition for a 1-year-old Tuul's cousin when I turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a child prodigy while memorizing Chinese characters at an early age, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. While learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through Chinese character tests, which allowed me to maintain excellent grades in Chinese characters in middle and high school. During my school years, I was able to achieve unexpected results through competition with my friends. I was competing with a friend who memorizes world geography, and I started memorizing world maps, and I got a good opportunity to appear in the Golden Bell. Another time, a friend who is similar in writing skills attends an essay writing academy and starts a book collection. Soon after, I won a prize in an essay contest for the first time in my life. I have always been an ordinary person. However, I have a strong desire to improve. After joining the company, I will compare myself with the people around me and make efforts to ensure that their strengths are mine. When I was in charge of the project with the theme of ""Responsibility"" corporate security, I collected the opinions of the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was lower than that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the inadequate parts. All of the team members said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested in. So I applied for a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, it was rejected because it was an important factor in the company's life or death. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard the news that the World IT Show is holding a special exhibition on industrial security. I was able to interview working-level officials with my team members, resolve my questions, and directly encounter security products and new technologies. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. We place importance on the principle of flexibility, and we always make plans and proceed with anything. As a result, many of our friends say that we are well-informed. There are times when things go smoothly with thorough preparation and planning, but when unexpected things go awry, there are times when things go awry. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to people around me. Whenever there is a disruption in my job performance, I will come up with a variety of second-best measures by combining the opinions of all the members. I will become a talented person who can cope with any crisis and perform successfully. Starting with the blood bus when I was a second grader, I have donated blood steadily. Donating blood is meaningful to me because of a small incident during my military service. I am donating after hearing that I, who used to be like brothers, needed a blood donation certificate through my grandfather's surgery. It was a good opportunity to feel that my small actions were of great help to the other person. Due to this, I have been able to pursue everyone's happiness based on my social contribution. After joining the company, I will start the 'Love Blood Donation Campaign' by informing the public of the need for blood donation. I will make it the warmest company in the country beyond the local community. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a student of ""Cyber Armageddon"". A train accident caused by a 9-year-old boy manipulating a TV remote control in the documentary shocked me a lot. After that, I started studying computer engineering by looking at the history of cyber terrorism and viruses. After completing my basic major, I took Internet security for stable system operation. I built and redistributed network construction using routers, and dynamic static routing tables, and also built firewalls using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time, and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for eight months and learned how to check security equipment and vulnerabilities for stable server operation. I think my strength is the experience of accessing various server OS through vocational education with undergraduate students. I will master work quickly with a high understanding of the server. In addition, based on the contents of the training, I challenged and passed the second-level network manager and the information processing engineer, and I am currently learning security laws aimed at obtaining an information security engineer."
"I thought that the driving force behind the development of civilization was the development of communication means. As a result, many ideas and civilizations were born, and I became interested in them, so I chose to major in the Department of Communication Engineering. I felt only the convenience before learning, but I learned that these technologies, which I felt naturally while learning my major knowledge, have progressed and are still changing rapidly. This job only leaves the cull of the moment I settle for learning, and I realized that a more efficient and economical challenge spirit is the most important with passion for new knowledge and creative thinking. In this way, I heard the news of KT's 5G, and I just happened to have an opportunity to visit before the opening of the PyeongChang Olympics and appreciated the technologies that will be introduced into the game. At this time, I saw the possibility of KT, which is running in the lead above any other company, and I wanted to join. Currently, it does not sound like an empty promise that the era will come when we reach the Fourth Industrial Revolution and do not need a refrigerator claimed by Jack Ma with the emergence of new technologies such as big data, AI, and IOT. Times are changing rapidly, and customer complaints are not 100% satisfactory due to the rising standard of satisfaction felt as technology advances. My biggest goal is to have the ideal network and KT's era in which customers can be 100% satisfied. Let me tell you about my experience in 3D printing that made me what I am today. I first came across 3D printing when I worked at an affiliated factory in a school that practiced engineering equipment and commissioned by external companies. When I first received my education, I first encountered 3D printers while learning the equipment in the factory, and I felt only vague and scary emotions. While feeling these emotions, the factory manager's joke that I should make a model with the 3D printer that I would choose was the biggest turning point in my life. It was a new challenge unrelated to my major, but I wanted to show that I did it because I was a junior in the same organization. The sense of accomplishment and pleasure at the time when I first learned by myself with the most basic design tools through web surfing and created the character Minion cannot be forgotten. When I touched various design tools, searched for related information, and learned the 3D printer based on my experience after numerous trials and errors, I was able to find myself different from the past. Confidence, passion, and willpower are weak. I have come to educate myself on 3D printing in front of others, lead two teams in the 3D printing club as a leader, and I have challenged a drone-related project to merge my major and 3D printer, a new challenge without being complacent. I have experience working on projects aimed at smart farm equipment in Capstone design. I gained confidence in the good results of being auctioned off at the Capstone design presentation, and proceeded with an industry-academia project in connection with the company for six months without stopping here. I aimed to complete the desired voice recognition and application collaboration in a company developed from the existing basic facilities. Initially, I was interested in the machinery sector because companies wanted a systematic structure that could be used in large-scale factories from a simple structure in the shape of a large pot, so I discussed with my team members to challenge. With the help of many data search and acquaintances, I was able to produce frames using profiles and motors, and I made the mistake of miscalling the motor drive in that I directly manufactured motors from Raspberry Pi. I found a way to control it through Arduino after agonizing over the responsibility of all the team members in a state of being unable to re-order it due to time construction. What I learned through trial and error was that we should not lose our will, such as building servers, linking computers with Raspberry Pi and mobile, and applying voice recognition technology for the first time, unexpected servers were locked in security, and Raspberry could not recognize voices. As I was performing my job, I realized that it is people who perform the job, and that a person's mindset is important. The attitude of the other branch is the core competency I thought of. When a company plans a project and technology development, the customer who is the target of the project should be the most important. After all, we need to consider what is needed, inconvenient, and more satisfactory from the customer's point of view for network management and development. The fact that IPv6 addresses were developed due to the lack of IPv4 addresses is that, in the end, customer demand increases, and more than 10 IOTs can be allocated per household due to the gradually complete IOT era as well as devices such as laptops and smartphones. Even if the world's 6 billion people are allocated just two per person, it is too much to speed up the newly developed technologies. At the same time, I thought that there were still many potential customers around the world in line with the era of globalization. As such, I thought that IPv6 was developed because the IPv4 address system had limitations in considering the future technologies and the number of potential customers. Technology does not always achieve right and good results, so I thought that the top priority for technology development in a company is always to consider whether it is possible to gain convenience, smoothness, and satisfaction from the customer's point of view when encountering this technology. When I learned new knowledge or looked for articles on new technologies, I thought about what they had developed these technologies and whether there were any other ways."
"Like the experience of learning JQuery that I didn't know well while creating the first site, Gametwo, and voluntarily working on renovations for higher completion, I have pursued 'dedication' that goes beyond my goals. As the final project of the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, our team used the spring MVC2 model to plan Gametwo based on the existing Gameone site. We started developing a baseball site with the theme of ""Baseball Site"" to implement functions that users can use more actively, including team creation and team site management, and to deal with vast amounts of data such as game records and rankings. As it was meant to be the first site, I wanted to create a site that was comparable to Gameone. To do this, I first learned by actively colliding with JQuery to be familiar with it. The actual site utilized asynchronous communication through Ajax to minimize reloading for the user's convenience. However, these contents were not covered in the class, so additional learning was required, so the team members wanted to implement the targeted functions within the scope of learning. I organized and implemented all 50 functions to learn the basics of JQuery, and I directly asked questions to Naver intellectuals for parts that were difficult to apply. The chat function and Ajax, which were difficult to solve, were implemented with remote help by person in charge of web development. And by sharing and teaching everyone the learned knowledge, I was able to create sophisticated functions, including toggles and date pickers. Next, after the project presentation, I spent about a month working on the repair work. The training was completed, but as a developer of the site, I was unable to implement it, or to observe incomplete sites such as functions that cause errors, and rugged web design. So I contacted the team leader first and suggested the repair work, and I fixed all errors that occurred by executing the functions one by one together. In particular, when registering for the lineup of the game, I contacted the front-end incumbent to create a function to visualize players in the stadium, and I was able to find and complete the clues. I will maintain the attitude of NCSOFT to passionately and devotedly perform it while performing something while performing the task. We will always provide high-quality services to customers by setting high standards on our own. In order to acquire the expertise of the data engineer's job, we have developed 'Hadoop Eco System' technology and 'constant communication' capabilities. After completing the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase using HDFS by reading through the book specializing in the Hadoop perfect guide with interest in Hadoop. In particular, we directly coded MapReduce to analyze vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus boarding/exit data and U.S. flight data to specify the learned knowledge. In addition, I believe that the most necessary competency in the job of data engineer is 'constant communication'. Constant communication with colleagues is essential in finding better ways to solve the problems faced and developing by making up for each other's shortcomings in the process. I have experience in successfully completing the 'Seoul Metropolitan Daily Rainfall Forecast Web and App' Hadoop project by introducing AWS Cloud through active communication with team members. In order to secure the capacity required to build a Hadoop cluster, we discussed problems and limitations with team members for each trial and error. After actively discussing the limitations of the existing method of using VMware with my team member, I was able to think of AWS that rents capacity virtually. I collected and organized academic materials, made them into a manual together, and learned EC2. Whenever an error occurred in private IP settings and putty accesses, I always looked for 'why' and after looking for a solution, AWS found that setting up a security group was the most important consideration. Finally, by allocating enough capacity, we were able to build a Hadoop cluster consisting of NameNode, Secondary NameNode, and three DataNodes. Since then, we have secured high availability through duplexing of NameNode using Zookeeper. We analyzed the precipitation data of Seoul City from 1908 to 2018 as MapReduce and successfully completed the project by storing the results in the MySQL DB and visualizing them with the web and apps. It was a small project, but it was able to achieve two fruits. First, we were able to not only solve the problem by approaching the problem in a different way than before, but also learn the IaaS cloud. I learned that new insights can be created when a large number of thoughts gather, not alone. In addition, I felt the importance of communication for problem solving by introducing a new environment called EC2. I was able to quickly find and correct errors that occurred by actively asking and giving advice on what we know each other. Like this experience, I will seek continuous improvement of the existing work process through active communication between colleagues and departments. In addition, I will not hesitate to acquire the necessary new skills to accurately reflect the customer's requirements. We will provide the necessary data stably with the ability to build a Hadoop distributed cluster for loading and operating large-capacity log data. NCSOFT cited AI as one of the new innovative technologies of the future and heard that it will create a new game play based on AI. Two goals were established to contribute to big data analysis by participating in the development direction of NCSOFT. First, I will learn the Hadoop Eco System technology necessary for big data infrastructure operation and development. So, I will understand the entire process from data collection to storage, processing, and analysis and quickly fall into practice. Based on the learned knowledge, we will quickly identify the data platform trends in the field and supplement the lack of data collection technology by acquiring Kafka, Flume open source. Since I have only dealt with processed csv structured data so far, I will even deal with unstructured data such as game log data and secure expertise.Second, I will develop my data analysis capabilities. If you lack an understanding of data terms and statistical techniques, you cannot provide the Dataset that analysts want. I will acquire open sources for data analysis such as Spark SQL, Streaming, and MLlib, and invest in self-development with the aim of ADP certification. Recently, I learned the API by learning Spark's development languages, scala and python, through a specialized book, and I am working on the MLlib project using them. In addition, I learned statistical techniques and R by acquiring ADsP. Based on this learning, I will quickly apply the necessary open-source skills."
"""IBK Industrial Bank Becoming a General Financial IT Company"" I visited the financial IT counseling booth at the in-school Job Festival held on campus last year. I came across a senior graduate who is currently working at a financial IT company at the booth. In the process of receiving counseling, I was told about the vision of financial IT. Since then, I have confirmed IBK Industrial Bank's business expansion in development and technical support for financial and fintech solutions such as ""opening a quick account"" and ""ARS foreign currency remittance,"" and I wanted to work for this company that is constantly growing in the fintech market. I have no experience in developing financial IT, but as a student majoring in computer engineering, I have faithfully gained project experience by utilizing JAVA, a computer language I learned, and I have made efforts to improve my communication skills through various external activities in addition to my major activities. Based on these experiences, I want to lead a comprehensive bank that manages not only SW development but also overall financial IT services. Currently, IBK Industrial Bank of Korea is expanding its investment business to prepare for the era of IT finance, including its equity investment in Webcash, a software company, and seven fintech companies, so I think it is necessary to strengthen manpower accordingly. If I join IBK Industrial Bank of Korea, I will sincerely learn the technology of non-face-to-face channel service, which is a future source of income, and try to become a member of the best recognized company in the overseas financial IT market in the long term. ""Activity - Attitude to fill the deficiencies"" As a digital employee, my competitiveness is activeness. It is because I have actively tried to make up for my shortcomings. The reason for this effort is the failure of the 'This is the OOO Competition'. When I was a freshman in college, I participated in the 'This is the Java Competition' using the 'This is the Java' textbook and proceeded with a project to implement the 'Java FX-based ATM'. By using the account creation login, the main page and the deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons, I aimed to execute the event on that button. However, because DB and JSP were not studied, they were not able to model data and code DAO and DTO classes on the server program based on the member data design, and they neglected to learn in this area. In the end, it remained an incomplete project that only implemented the ATM button function excluding the login function. With this opportunity, we made two efforts to improve the value of actively approaching technologies that we have not learned. First, I completed lectures not only from university classes but also from other IT institutions. After completion of the course, I implemented the 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system' using the recently frequently used bootstrap 4 framework. In the process of creating a web-based program, I experienced the process of web development from web design, web server development, function test and distribution. In addition, while designing the 'Hospital DB', it was schematized into an ER diagram, and 20 work process scenarios that may occur in the hospital were set and printed out, thereby enhancing the logical analysis skills required for digital employees. Second, through working in the Air Force computer room and field training in the summer, I got an opportunity to learn in the field rather than theoretical learning. Such active learning habits will be able to demonstrate their capabilities to contribute to the advancement of smart financial services such as big data and fintech by IBK in the future. ""We will show you sustainable creativity."" I think the attitude of planning and developing unprecedented tasks is an opportunity for digital employees to improve new ideas. With the recent high issue of fine dust, we decided to create an app that measures the value of fine dust using Arduino, fine dust sensors, GPS sensors, and Bluetooth modules under the theme of the graduation project, displays the measured area on Google Maps, and represents the value of fine dust in a graph chart. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing fine dust measuring stations. Later, through a meeting with the team members, we tried a differentiated method of attaching a fine dust sensor by manufacturing an Arduino drone. The disadvantage of not being able to provide accurate information to people due to the lack of monitoring stations nationwide was to obtain the value of dust in the area that we wanted to check through drone control. Although we received a deduction in terms of commercialization, we were evaluated by the professor for breaking away from the measurement method in a fixed place and approaching the problem with a new perspective. Through this, I had the experience of agonizing over finding ideas that did not adhere to the existing methods in that I presented new ideas and implemented the final results. However, I was very disappointed that the government failed to consider users, such as designating drone-restricted zones and restricting altitude, after the project was completed. By supplementing these problems, I learned a lesson to make users think about their customers all the time. ""Achievements as one"" I have experience in effective promotional activities by encouraging team members in offline activities of OOO Korea. I loved traveling and wanted to apply to OOO Korea supporters and interact with college students with similar interests. Building friendship among team members was the most important in our activities, so we scheduled dinner every two weeks and talked about each other. Conversations helped to boost team morale, and we voluntarily planned offline promotional activities that were not mandatory activities. However, during offline activities in Yeouido Mulbit Plaza, not all team members could easily reach the citizens. I approached the citizens humorously first so that the team members could work without feeling awkward and confident, and when the team members first spoke to the citizens, I was supported by them and helped them to work actively. After the activities were over, the team members expressed their gratitude to me for being considerate and instilling a small courage. Above all, it was good that all the team members were able to enjoy their activities without feeling awkward because of me. I found that solving problems through such small consideration to my colleagues helps improve the team atmosphere."
"""Game and QA"" It was always a way to stop playing games. At first, it was just a way to have fun and relieve stress. When an error occurred while enjoying the game, I continued to create similar situations, looked for the reason for the error, and when I found the reason, I felt a sense of accomplishment. At the same time, I learned about Close Beta, and I always applied for games I was interested in, trying to detect errors before the game was released. Later, I went to the software department, and while taking a course called software engineering, I learned about the job of QA and became interested in it as I learned about various test tools and techniques. After that, I was able to try out the methods I learned while working on my graduation project. I thought I had done a perfect job in development, but I was surprised that there were errors that were found. I was able to find parts where the inequality was set wrong, and I was able to correct the wrong code by looking at an actuator that was operating differently than expected. As I discovered and solved the problem, I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment and interest. Afterwards, I learned about the CSTS certificate while I was looking into it because I wanted to study it more deeply, and I was able to apply for a related lecture. After taking the lecture, I failed at first on the test, and after that, I studied harder so I was able to pass the second test. I learned about game QA while thinking about the job of QA, which I was interested in, and what would allow me to experience games that I was interested in. There is a saying that goes, ""Genius cannot beat those who try, and those who try cannot beat those who enjoy."" Until now, if you have been an ""effort"" to become a game QA, from now on, I want to become a ""effort"" by becoming a game QA myself. I have never tested the game using test tools and techniques myself, but I think that I can quickly become an ""effort"" with overall knowledge about the test and interest and knowledge about the game. After planning and developing the ""The! The! The!"" game, you can release a single completed game. However, I don't think there is a perfect game without errors. Although there were no problems at the time of development, many unexpected errors can be found, such as compatibility with the device or OS immediately after release or user input mistakes. These errors will reduce the completeness of the game, which can act as a factor to reduce user interest. In addition, correcting it after release is expensive and time consuming, and can cause inconvenience to users. I think the QA job is what is needed to release more complete and satisfying games with less cost and time. During the vacation ""Necessity of QA through Experience"", I had an internship at an SI company for a month. During the month-long period, I was able to test the Yongin City water supply network system and write a user guide. With two developers and another intern, we tested the function based on the requirement definition. After each test was conducted, the errors found were sorted out, and the problems were improved through meetings with the developer. Other errors occurred depending on the OS, device, and web browser used, and when looking at the errors found by others, there were errors that I had not thought of. I could feel the need for various test cases as I saw errors in which data was not saved when decimal points were entered in the part of entering numbers, errors that worked well in Explorer, but did not work in Chrome. No one had specialized knowledge of testing, and I didn't use test tools, so I needed more time, and I felt that there were many shortcomings. Through this, I felt that I needed a professional QA."
"""Campfire on Fire"" I'd like to compare Nepass Co., Ltd. to a song called ""Campfire"" by Peppertons. It's because ""Campfire"" sits in front of the campfire in the midst of an unstable future, reminiscing about good things, and singing about the conviction that I will continue to shine. In the semiconductor and IOT industries, which may be unstable because they always develop new technologies and change frequently across the industry, Nepass Co., Ltd. created a pleasant company atmosphere based on ""Song Management"" and ""Thank You Management"" and developed the world's first ""Neuromorphic Chip."" Since chips have the characteristics of neurons as their name suggests, Nepass Co., Ltd. was convinced that they would grow by implementing artificial intelligence in their machines, so I came up with the song ""Campfire"" in connection with Nepass. Especially, the lyrics that I liked the most are ""Sing to See. We shall shine here like the burning light."" If I become a member of the production technology IT department of Nepass Co., Ltd., I will contribute to such technological advancement. ""Production: New Start and End of Customer Satisfaction."" The production of the product is a new start, and the way to satisfy customers is after all, the product. In the process of production, which was an important start, I designed the automation system to be more efficient and reliable, and supported the customer's entire process for fast and correct production. ""Industrial engineering knowledge, creativity, and communication skills."" I have learned statistics necessary for lean production methods through my major in industrial engineering and have studied logistics, reliability, and ergonomics necessary for FDC, RMS, and EAP design. By conducting projects using C and C++ languages, I can approach and solve problems anew based on the subjects of Practical TRIZ or Design Methodology. I worked on about 30 projects, both large and small, with students from various majors, understanding the differences and developing communication skills. Based on this, I am confident that I will be able to become a member of the production technology IT department of Nepass Co., Ltd. and help realize the SMART factory. I was the team leader for a year while preparing for the graduation work for the subject of ""Leading Graduation Work and Winning Competition"" and ""Industrial Engineering Capstone Design."" The theme was ""Selection of Hub Location for Optimization of Blood Logistics."" To this end, I collected the necessary data and created a cluster of hospitals using the R program, and produced them with PPT. I made and calculated a formula for the assumption of data utilization situation. In addition, I found the theory and shared it with my team members. I shared the work by considering the strengths and circumstances of the team members. When there was a friction between the classmates while the work was in progress, I heard enough about the two and conveyed to each other that there was a misunderstanding in the desire to perform the task well even in a busy situation. I organized the data with the two classmates and submitted the graduation work by supplementing the PPT. Despite the trial and error, our team was selected as an outstanding team on campus and received a silver award by submitting to the SCM competition for Korean university students. ""I am grateful for everything from one thing to ten."" 1. Having the health to see, hear, and move. 2. Meeting my family and friends in a variety of environments and choices. 4. What my parents waited for me to challenge myself enough. 5. Having the opportunity to do design engineering as well as industrial engineering at university. 7. Being born in an era of computer-aided possibilities. 8. Having touching culture and arts, such as beautiful music, dance, painting, exercise, food, and so on. 9. Having people who like me and like me. 10. It was hard to deduce only 10 things to be thankful for today's nice weather. I will always be grateful for. I have been a person who is 'generous to others and strict to me'. They understood other people's problems well, but I didn't really take care of myself, so my trivial problems made me feel intimidated. At the time, I chose to major in multiple majors and felt burdened with my studies and lacked confidence compared to design majors, so I controlled my mind by reading self-improvement books and humanities books to overcome them. Meanwhile, I learned the method called ""artist date."" ""Artist date"" is about meeting yourself once a week alone, doing what I want to do, and I spent time taking a walk around the neighborhood or stopping by art galleries and flower markets to fully relax and enjoy. Through ""Artist Date,"" I took care of myself, saw and felt various things around me, and my stubborn heart softened. As a result, I became more flexible in my thoughts and participated more actively in my studies, and above all, as I had a heart that loved me, I learned how to be considerate of others with more sincerity than before."
"I have the experience of launching a smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO museum. I was in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them using BLE signals, but I found a problem that the accuracy was low due to signal distortion and refraction caused by high ceilings and steel walls. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but I constantly visited the site every day for better performance, observing facilities and people, and looking for ways to overcome the crisis. After hard work, I overcame the crisis by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors to significantly reduce the error rate. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. I found that commercialization services were very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time, as errors can even lead to loss of customers. Through this, it was possible to indirectly experience the process of creating a new service at a company such as SK C&C, and it was also a representative achievement experience that was most meaningful because I could sympathize with the many people's efforts behind it. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and participated with planning, design, and majors, and it was a time to communicate with the multidisciplinary team and experience the design process. I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with SK based on the convergence and collaboration capabilities that have designed the entire process from problem recognition to solution. I saw many students standing in line in the elevator on the way to class, and I looked for a way to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I played the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce elevator congestion. When I investigated previous studies and cases, there was a case where it was manufactured using a pressure sensor. It was judged that the use of a pressure sensor could cause frequent breakdowns when many people used it, and it was differentiated by a non-contact method and a low unit price infrared sensor in order to use it without minor failure for a long time. A project to solve the problem was carried out in academic consumption. A scale suitable for each step was outputted through a speaker by detecting a person's foot with a sensor. Troubleshooting by electricity occurred during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis, and it was solved through ground reorganization. It was memorable for a long time that it was installed on campus for three days and received the attention of students and professors, and that it resolved the inconvenience that began with the sense of improvement. Above all, it remains an unforgettable memory that we solved the inconvenience in life through the project. In addition, in the Subway Passenger Distribution System by using CO2 Concentrations Data study, I remember getting on the subway line 1 directly to measure carbon dioxide and count the passengers in the cabin one by one. After analyzing the correlation between the amount of carbon dioxide and people, I was able to achieve the results of exhibiting it at the IoT Conference Demo Session held in Germany. When I participated in the medical hackathon, I had meetings with medical experts, developers, and designer participants and thought deeply about the products and services that people need. With the hope that surgical patients will recover quickly with the help of this walking aid, just as cats carefully walk in small spaces, the team participated in the event as a team called ""CatWalk Beautiful Accompaniment."" CatWalk provides exercise guides and allows customized walking exercises. In fact, most surgical patients have to walk, but they have a lot of difficulties in how much they should exercise and whether they are doing it correctly. CatWalk has implemented it by intuitively showing customized exercise guidelines and real-time exercise progress graphs based on exercise distance, exercise time, and gait dependence on existing walkers by reflecting opinions on walking issues at hospitals. Unlike simple coding competitions or contests where developers gather to present ideas, it was a more special experience in that they were able to consider and implement services needed by patients with on-the-job medical staff and designers. Thanks to what they learned and experienced while conducting convergence research, they were able to receive popularity and special awards. The New ICT field, the Application C language, is the language that I have learned the longest because it is used in various fields from application programming to network, system, and graphic programming. At the college level, I am good enough to implement a demo program, and I can say that it is the most confident language. Recently, I became interested in Watson through a webinar, and I have the experience of presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association using a Watson API demo. The thesis topic is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and the experiment was conducted using Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech demonstrations with high recognition rates. Recently, I tried to install a kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi and controlled GPIO. Finally, I was able to link the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and store it in the database and even check it on the web. In addition, I have produced artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker using open source, and while studying deep learning, I have experience implementing cost function and gradient design function in Python language. Even after joining SK C&C, I want to study the deep learning field in AIBRIL business. Last semester, I studied classification algorithms such as SVM and statistics through data mining class.Since June, beacon data has been collected and analyzed in the project ""Development of Robustness and Precision Improvement Technology in Indoor Location Estimation Technology"". In the ""Development and Validation of Interactive Language Learning Device"" project, we are testing a demonstration of an object recognition application that has learned 1,000 objects using TensorFlow, and we are constantly looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. I have experience in developing art tools to reduce the experience waiting time with Children's Hospital of Seoul OO Hospital. Many hospitals have been agonizing over the problem since many complaints have been raised among patients about the long waiting time and the short treatment time for many years, but they have not been able to come up with a suitable alternative. In the lab, a team of Humaneers (Human + Engineering) were gathered and made a cooperative proposal through e-mail to the hospital. The hospital also received an answer that it recognized the problem and let's solve it together, and we recognized the limitations that we could not physically solve and cooperated by continuously communicating and solving them from a psychological perspective. The biggest reason why we were able to solve the problem was the rendezvous between various majors. Due to the nature of the laboratory, I think it was possible to achieve outstanding results because humanities, design, and engineering majors went through the entire process from problem recognition to solutions through collaboration. Even though I was an engineer, I participated in discovering problems by observing them at the hospital for three days with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and through interviews, I was able to hear the thoughts of doctors, nurses, and patients. When developing the demo, it reflected all of what I felt in the field. The level of manipulation was determined according to the patient's age group, and the range of automation was determined according to the workload of nurses. Finally, the pictures drawn by children were inputted through a scanner and implemented so that it could become a fairy tale story on the TV in the waiting room."
"While preparing for the wearable software contest, I became interested in the game industry. We developed a smart band and an attention game, and linked a headband that can measure brain waves with a mobile game to induce children with attention deficit disorder to focus. For the first time in charge of developing Android games, there were many difficulties in the process of implementing Bluetooth communication, but I looked for books in the library and referenced open sources on the Internet to implement them. As a result, it ended up winning an encouragement award, but it is still a good memory because it is the first project in college that was not good. Through the first project, I was able to break the perception that games are bad, and I realized that if I plan and develop them well, they can be valuable tools to people. Currently, we are working on a project to develop art tools to reduce the amount of time spent waiting, and we are improving the problem of long waiting times compared to medical hours, which have been raised as many complaints among patients for years. Although I am an engineer, I was able to find unexpected parts in the desk research process through three days of observation at the hospital with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design, and I was able to hear the thoughts of doctors, nurses, and patients through interviews. When I developed the demo, I reflected everything I felt in the field. Finally, the children's drawings were inputted through a scanner and the contents that became a fairy tale on the TV in the waiting room were implemented. If the previous game industry was far from everyday life, I think it will melt into everyday life and blur the boundaries with various cultural industries in the future. I want to provide value of life through games and bring joy to people. Through the on-campus Job Fair event, I was able to feel Netmarble's remarkable growth and responsibility, and I supported it because I was convinced that Netmarble, which is leading the global game culture by bringing joy to people around the world through games, will be able to grow together by becoming a fan. The areas that are drawing attention in the 4th Industrial Revolution include artificial intelligence, IoT, cloud computing, big data, mobile, and blockchain, but I think data will be the most important core. Since the games published and developed by Netmarble have hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users, they have more user data than any other company that cannot be converted into money. The user data stored in the data center takes up only storage and is nothing more than useless trash if not analyzed and processed. In the future, Netmarble is responsible for analyzing user data acquired through games to create value, and if this is achieved, I think it can not only expand its business area but also leap into a global game culture company. For example, if we collect standardized data such as the user's age, gender, chat record, item purchase pattern, access time, and location, predict qualitative data such as personality and interpersonal relationships through statistics and analysis, and target marketing that is actively used for story reflection and marketing in the game according to the user's current status, it will be a good game and lead to excellent results. In order to value the data Netmarble has, I think the first thing to do is not to look at the problem only in one aspect, but to hire talented people with convergence capabilities to think from various aspects and to communicate with experts in various disciplines. For two years, I formed a multidisciplinary team with humanities, design, planning, and majors in graduate school to collaborate on all processes from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted human-centered studies on HCI, UX, and IoT were very similar to the Knowhow-Sharing system and T-type talent training system, which become members of Netmarble. I think the past experiences have laid the foundation for us to think about and prepare for the future with Netmarble. I want to become a talented person who can lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution with Netmarble, a company that can lead the era of the 4th industrial revolution. First, in terms of the business area, I want to create a game that can simply give knowledge or wisdom in life out of pleasure. If you look at the recently released films, you can see many films based on historical facts or true stories. I was able to become more immersed and attract the public's attention by using visually dynamic images through cultural life, unlike in the past, when I studied historical events simply through writing. I thought that it would be a more immersive and enjoyable game for all ages if historical events or everyday life were made into a story in the game in the same way and developed so that I could experience it indirectly. Second, in terms of the personnel system, since a person is the purpose of being, I would like to make it possible to carry pride in the company by guaranteeing lifetime employment without evaluating it through relative comparison with others. Many companies are making it an endlessly competitive society through performance-oriented incentives. This is becoming a vicious cycle in which many office workers are under increased stress and their efficiency decreases. Contrary to other companies, with the adoption of a salary system, I would like to reduce performance incentives to a minimum, and operate it so that employees can exercise their autonomous growth and capabilities by arousing enthusiasm through the company's trust and responsibility. Third, in terms of social contribution, I would like to establish a public interest foundation. I want to foster a good company that fulfills its social responsibility and does its duty, unlike past companies that only pursue profits through activities such as delivering a small amount of consolation money to those who suffered from accidents, disasters, or disasters, and awarding personality awards to those who sacrificed themselves for the country and society. First, I want to work with a colleague who is proud and attached to the company and enjoys working. It is commonly known that game companies have high intensity of work and are continuous overtime every day. As much as people feel differently when they do things they like and when they do things they dislike, if they do not enjoy the work, they may be stressed out every day and even hurt the people around them.The reason why the engineer's dream, which I decided in middle school, was able to maintain without changing is because it was fun to conduct convergence research using IT technology. I was able to go to graduate school because of my aptitude, and unlike other laboratories, my affiliated laboratory has the advantage of creating synergies by gathering humanities, design, planning, and engineering majors to go through all the processes from problem recognition to solutions. Because I have a sense of pride and attachment to the laboratory, I feel proud without having difficulty studying with my colleagues until late at night. Second, I want to work with a colleague who respects the capabilities of others, and a colleague who can discover strengths and make up for weaknesses. In an organization, every member is precious. Sometimes I think that even though some are good and others seem invisible, all of the team members must grow together. I think the biggest reason why we were able to successfully complete studies to create value that did not exist before, such as subway passenger distribution system, display smart curating service, and improving waiting time for children's hospitals, starting with intervention device research with store owners due to the occupancy time of cafe customers in graduate school, was because of the mindset of all colleagues who majored in humanities, design, planning, and engineering to properly utilize each other's strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. Based on my past experiences, I think it will be a pleasant working life if I am with the above two types of colleagues, and I am confident that all talented people who join Netmarble will be good colleagues. I became interested in AI through webinar, and I have experience presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association using IBM Watson API demo. The topic of the thesis is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and I was able to experience Watson's Visual Recognition and Text to Speech demo, which has a high recognition rate. He is currently studying deep learning and is also studying various classification algorithms through supporting statistics and data mining classes. Using open sources, he created an artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker, and implemented a stock price prediction program. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing a demonstration of an object recognition application that has learned 1,000 objects, and we are reading related papers to find ways to increase the recognition rate. From June, he participated in the research project ""Study for environmental performance of robustness and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indirect location estimation"" and is in charge of data collection and analysis. As it is currently in the early stages of research, we are looking for related studies, and finally, the final goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through the deep learning process of AP wireless signals. Although I am still at the beginner level since I just started studying AI, I confidently promise that I will grow up with my outstanding colleagues at Netmarble in the future and become a talented person who will lead the company in the distant future. Research can be defined differently depending on the field of study or the times, but I think it is a process of deeply learning about the object in common. Research can clarify the expression or explanation of the object, and it can also uncover the correlation. Correlation can predict the future, or control and manipulate it based on the predicted results. Recently, many companies are accelerating AI research. When a logic that imitates the human brain is designed and implemented so that computers can judge on their own, it is already more accurate and faster than humans in the field of image processing and voice recognition. In the future, AI research is expected to be used in various fields. In order to plan and conduct AI research, I think it is important not only to have statistics and mathematical abilities, but also to understand the knowledge of HCI or UX, and the trend of the times. It is not common for engineering majors to study UX, but I think it will be difficult to create good services without going through UX design courses that understand people's behavior and emotions rather than technology in the future. I was able to learn the engineering competencies I learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics engineering and the approaches to defining problems and solving problems through convergence research at the graduate school. A product or service includes core technology, but in the end, the ultimate target of technology is people, so it will be a more meaningful and necessary study if the context is understood and developed from the research stage. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I set a quantitative goal of reading more than one trend book per month. As new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day in the IT field, I want to study the discovery, implementation, test, and application of new technologies repeatedly to keep up with the trend."
"In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book per month, and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. As new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day in the IoT and artificial intelligence fields, I want to become a talented person who challenges myself by repeating the process of discovering, implementing, testing, and applying new technologies to keep up with the trend. I feel energized and happy when I accomplish something I don't think I can do. When I was traveling in the Philippines, I challenged myself to scuba dive and got an Open Water license even though I couldn't swim due to my water phobia. This may seem easy, but because of the memory of drowning in a swimming pool in elementary school, I never dreamed of going into the sea 18m in my life. I recognized that the reality that I couldn't always have fun when I went to a swimming pool was a problem that I had to overcome someday, and I was able to challenge the saying that the underwater in the Philippines is one of the world's top 10 diving points. At first, I started with a light thought that it would be more comfortable to go into the water with an oxygen respirator, but contrary to my expectations, I experienced death due to pain caused by waves and air pressure. Previously, I was busy avoiding anything difficult, but looking back, most of them were trivial things that I could do. Experiencing underwater helped me a lot improve my confidence, have a positive mindset to solve problems, and develop my ability to see the forest rather than the tree. If I join Woori Bank, I want to become a person who creates existing values by converging technology and customers' businesses based on future technologies. Core technologies are included in products and services, but in the end, people are the ultimate targets of technology, so it will be more meaningful and necessary research if the context is understood and developed from the research stage. As Woori Bank is reinforcing its digital jobs, it is studying deep learning, one of the fields of artificial intelligence, and is also studying various classification algorithms through statistics and data mining classes to support it. Using open sources, we have produced AI Amazon Alexa with raspberry pie, microphone, and speaker, and have also implemented stock price prediction programs. Based on the research capabilities we have carried out, we want to focus on the development of financial products based on artificial intelligence and research on digital marketing. Furthermore, I would like to create customer value that did not exist before by converging core technologies with customer business. In the ""Development and validation of interactive language learning device"" project, we are testing object recognition application demos that have learned 1000 objects and are looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, companies with data will change our world. Woori Bank secured a lot of customer data and applied with confidence that it will become the best financial company if it makes good use of it. Together with Woori Bank, we want to make the future imaginary financial aspects a reality. I have experience in launching IoT-based smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO Museum. I was in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them by using BLE signals, but I found a problem that the accuracy was low due to the distortion and refraction of the signal caused by the high ceiling and steel wall. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but I constantly visited the site every day to observe facilities and people for better performance and looked for ways. After much consideration, we overcame the crisis by significantly lowering the error rate by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors. Through this, a number of papers were published and two patents were filed. I found that commercialization services were very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time, as errors could lead to the loss of customers. Through this, I was able to experience a little indirectly the process of the creation of a new service in a company, and I could also sympathize with the many efforts behind it, which was the most meaningful achievement. I have experience in developing art tools to reduce the waiting time at Seoul OO Hospital and Children's Hospital. Many hospitals have been agonizing over the problem since many years ago due to the long waiting time and the short treatment time, but they have not been able to come up with a suitable alternative. In the laboratory, a team of Humaneers (Human + Engineers) were gathered to propose cooperation to the hospital through e-mail. The hospital also received an answer to recognize the problem and solve it together, and we recognized the limitations that cannot be physically solved, and we worked together through constant communication and cooperation to solve them from a psychological perspective. The biggest reason I was able to solve the problem was creative thinking and a shift in thinking. I think I was able to achieve excellent results because humanities, design, and engineering majors collaborated through rendezvous between various majors to go through the whole process from problem recognition to solutions. I also participated in the work of discovering problems by observing them at the hospital for three days with my team members who majored in humanities, planning, and design. By breaking the old idea that engineers only work at desks and going out to the field, I had the experience of discovering unexpected parts in the desk research process. Since my dream of creating new things has always been in my heart, I am going to graduate school and focusing on research activities related to HCI and IoT. Woori Bank also wants to advance toward my dream by researching new technologies and developing business models that integrate finance. I feel proud and attached to the fact that I am currently conducting human-centered research based on new technologies in H-Lab. The human-friendly HCI field pursued by H-Lab is considered an essential discipline in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, but in the case of Korea, it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as an early stage.I am confident that I can contribute to the future even if I become a member of Woori Bank by learning for two years the research capabilities that can create the best synergy effect by designing every process from problem recognition to solutions by gathering humanities, design, and engineering majors. It will be a better strategy if you understand and study human contexts from the early stages. We are used to constantly creating new things through multidisciplinary convergence research, and we will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out social and human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes based on user experience rather than technology-oriented."
"""Central Inventory Management System with Creativity"" My extraordinary talent is 'creativity'. I have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to my enhanced technology based on my experience in various projects. For example, I proposed a central inventory management system by showing creativity in the 'Improving the Inventory Management System of Clothing Stores' project. When using online clothing stores, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. Since it was difficult to link the order information DB and the inventory DB in real time, I decided that it was not a difficult task for companies. In order to solve this problem, I suggested benchmarking the OOO service, which is a method of delivering order information by store, after receiving orders collectively from the central government. To differentiate it from the OOO service, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. It was well received by the professor in charge of the system that satisfied the efficiency of corporate operation and the needs of customers, and it won first place in creativity and convenience among a total of eight teams. I was able to come up with creative ideas by expanding my thoughts, not limited to clothing stores. Through IT services based on creativity, we are ready to support Korean Yakult, which strives to develop 'New One Product' rather than 'Me Too Product'. In this way, I will deliver a true impression to everyone who is engaged in Korean Yakult. ""Korea Yakult's co-worker"" The most difficult experience was when I worked on a project to improve the school's course registration system. To make matters worse, a team member who was in charge of PM due to early employment was excluded in the middle and had to bear a large amount of work, and I suffered from a team member who was lagging behind. As I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course, gave questions and answers to them at times through messenger, and helped my team members understand. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I made it without difficult for myself to write DFD. My task alone was very overwhelming. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the position of my team members by recalling the old self, which was difficult, and I tried hard to recall that it was not a goal alone, but a common goal. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without a single dropout, resulting in high-quality results. I think I was able to achieve results because I shared and led the difficulties of my team members. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration, and I have grown into a person who practices collaboration in person. I will be a co-worker of Korean Yakult who can trust me to encourage my team members and improve work performance without giving up no matter what difficulties I face. ""A company that values basics, only kicks 100 times,"" and how much I value 'basics' is the most important criterion for choosing a company. This is because employees who have been based on basics can grow into talented people who don't have any qualms about new challenges. With the vitalization of hypermarkets, door-to-door sales were recognized as an outdated distribution channel, but Korean Yakult still makes it a principle to deliver products directly to consumers. As such, Korean Yakult values basics, so it can maintain its operating profit ratio of 9% which is rare in the food industry, and I think that 'cold brew' and 'frozen yakult' which hit the jackpot were also derived from these basics. I learned the importance of the basics by preparing taegwonmu through overseas volunteer cultural performances. I was always bad at dancing during the kindergarten talent show, so I was naturally placed on the edge of a large scale. However, I practiced with the goal of completing such a perfect movement that I could stand on the main stage. At first, I only practiced kicking more than 100 times, which is the basic movement of Taekwonmu. I was tired of monotonous movements, but I was more confident in practicing kicking than anyone else, so I was able to easily learn the difficult movements derived from kicking. After these efforts, I was nicknamed the ""dancing queen"" by Mongolian children. I will contribute to the healthy change of Korea along with the Korea Yakult by demonstrating my own abilities, which have been strengthened with solid basic skills. ""Building a Healthy World with Korean Yakult"" As IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, is actively taking place, I realize that IT is indispensable in the industry. I majored in industrial engineering and was fascinated by IT that supports the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a healthy world with Korean Yakult. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as a talented person suitable for the Korea Yakult IT job. ""First, competencies required to carry out tasks."" IT personnel must have development skills as well as an understanding of the industry. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to grasp the characteristics of the industry sharply by working on various projects that combine IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design Using Cloud Computing"" and ""Improvement of Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores."" I decided that the foundation of IT was data, and I majored in statistics to learn in-depth about data processing and analysis. While learning statistical programming such as SAS or R, I developed numerical analysis skills. After completing the undergraduate program, I took a course to train applied SW and DB engineers at the OOO Institute of Education and learned various IT knowledge such as Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, Java Script, Oracle, Spring Framework, and MyBatis. By using the knowledge I learned, I developed practical skills by conducting development projects such as ""Free Video Lecture Site"" and ""Second, Used Auction Site."" ""Second, Competencies Required for Work Life."" After working as an intern at OO Research for six months, I learned the basics of work life that are trivial, but should never be overlooked.For example, I realized that it is more important to ask questions immediately and to learn exactly what you have been instructed to do, and to give prompt and correct outcomes, rather than to reverse the situation by yourself if there is a blockage. I will realize my dream of building a healthy society with the Korea Yakult based on my IT experience that I have challenged so far. Mrs. Yakult is a key competitive advantage of Korean Yakult in that it is Mrs. Yakult that the direct link between the seller and the consumer of Korean Yakult is Mrs. Yakult. However, I think there is a limit to door-to-door sales for modern people who are so busy that the new term ""time poor"" is emerging. This is because more and more people are using hypermarkets or online shopping due to their busy schedule. As a countermeasure, I came up with a way to activate the Korean Yakult mobile app. If you set a desired date and time through the app and meet Ms. Yakult, I think you can maximize the convenience of customers while maintaining the advantage of door-to-door sales that allows them to hear product information in person. In addition, if we add intuitive and convenient functions such as voice recognition and simple payment system for middle-aged and elderly people who are not familiar with using the app, I think Korea Yakult will be able to become a company loved by all customers of all ages. ""Real-time Inventory Management System for Customer Health"" Unlike general industrial products, food products should be more careful than anything else in managing their inventory because product defects are directly related to consumer health. This is because dairy products have a short shelf life of about 12 days, so it can be very fatal if inventory occurs. In the case of Cold Brew, we have a strategy of selling it only for 10 days after roasting, so it is also being sold at major department store food halls to secure additional sales channels. Since it is being sold through various channels, it is expected that there will be difficulties in managing inventory. To solve this difficulty, we devised a program for a display that outputs real-time inventory information in conjunction with the SCM, or a program for a device that immediately checks product information such as inventory and updates the changed inventory information in real time. We will improve the management efficiency of Korean Yakult by designing the envisioned program ourselves and contribute to the health of all customers who love Korean Yakult."
"The Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo, which promotes maximum customer satisfaction through bio-certification and simple services, is an ideal company to realize my dream of contributing to the happiness of all customers of all ages. We will develop a second MG mobile bank with the Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo, which actively responds to the future financial IT environment such as upgrading information integration system and establishing an IT center, to practice the warmth of embracing 'people'. I hope to develop an app. Seeing my parents who have difficulty issuing public certificates, I thought that I would like to develop an app that includes voice recognition function to give convenience to the middle-aged and the elderly who are not familiar with using the app. In order to implement the envisioned app directly, trust with customers who are app users and expertise in developing IT services are required. I learned this by developing survey pages in OO Research. In order to maximize the user's convenience, I gained trust by asking for feedback from my team members several times, and gained expertise by learning various IT knowledge such as MyBatis, Spring, and JSP. We will work with the Korea Federation of Saemaul Geumgo to realize the app we envisioned as a trusted and professional employee. In preparation for the ""Bright Energy"" contest, I encouraged my team members with bright energy. We prepared a surprise snack for the team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and we completed the preparation for the contest safely within the period by exerting our rechargeable energy by eating snacks and talking. At that time, the team members nicknamed me 'the energizer', saying they had never seen a bright friend like you. By working on the ""Cooperation"" and ""Improvement of the in-school course registration system"", we showed cooperation and obtained the final evaluation result from the 7th place in the interim evaluation to the 2nd place. A team member who was an revenge major student was left behind due to his lack of basic UML knowledge. I delivered a note that I had organized the points for the team member and helped them with Q&A. It was a little difficult at first, but as a result of steadily helping them learn, they did it by themselves, and as a result, they drew everyone's participation without a single fallback. ""Responsibility"" I worked part-time at an academy for a year and prepared class by arriving 20 minutes in advance each time. Even after class, I helped with the Q&A through messenger, and most of the students I taught improved by an average of 5 points or more. I was even offered a regular teacher, saying that I was the first teacher who had never been late. ""Speed"" I tend to speak faster when I am nervous or excited. On the day of the graduation project presentation, professors of my department said that it would have been a better presentation if I had slowed down my speech a little. I am trying to organize things in my head and talk calmly before I speak out to convey my words. I get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my ""strong desire to win."" After finishing second out of six teams in a sports competition when I was a freshman, I couldn't get my hands on things all day, which hindered my studies. In order to overcome my shortcomings, I try to look at the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon, even if I experience a series of failures. ""Irgent personality"" There are times when I feel pressure from people around me due to my urgent personality. When I prepared for the fall conference, I felt nervous because I saw signs of being a little behind schedule. This urgent personality put unexpected pressure on other team members. In order to ease the burden on each other, I decided to help my team members after finishing my task quickly rather than just watching and getting nervous. I took the first step as an IT manager by taking an applied SW engineer training course at the OOOO Institute of Education. I experienced a sense of responsibility in planning, designing, and developing various projects such as 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Second-hand Auction Site' and developed my communication skills in the process of gathering opinions from team members. As I engaged in development with the user's convenience at every button location, my dream as an IT manager became firm and I gained confidence in the development. ""First Social Experience, OO Research"" While working as an intern at OO Research, I learned the basics of company life that are trivial, but should never be overlooked. For example, when I received a task, I realized that it was more important to ask immediately and to get the exact instructions and give the right results rather than to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage. ""Mongolian Overseas Service Created through Collaboration"" An unexpected problem occurred while I was volunteering to install a garbage dump in OOO Ger 2-dong, Mongolia, with only five days left until the departure date. At first, I thought it would be impossible, but I was able to complete the service safely within a period of time thanks to the power of 24 members without a single alien. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration and have grown into a person who practices collaboration. ""The number of participants in the OOO Supporters event increased by 200%."" Judging that the main purchasing group was not limited to university students, the venue was changed to a downtown area and the number of participants increased by 200%. An event was held in Myeong-dong under the concept of 'OO Game with OOO' by parodying the hit movie Avengers at the time. The event, which was planned with the team members from one to ten, such as selecting a place and purchasing goods, was well received by more than 400 people. Since then, I have gained confidence that there is nothing I cannot do if I have a spirit of challenge that is not afraid of change. ""Central Inventory Management System where Everyone is Convenient"" With the experience of various projects, I have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to the technology I have learned. For example, a central inventory management system was proposed by demonstrating creativity in the 'Clothes Store Inventory Management Improvement Project'. When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory.In order to solve this problem, we suggested benchmarking the OOO service, which is a method of receiving orders collectively from the center and delivering order information by store. To differentiate it from the OOO service, we added a function to recommend nearby stores by identifying the location of customers through GPS location-based services. It received favorable reviews from the professor in charge for its efficiency in operating the company and the system that satisfies the needs of customers. Through financial IT services based on creative thinking, we will become a creative central member of the Saemaul Geumgo Central Association that quickly relieves customer inconvenience and delivers true impressions."
"I think the ""challenge"" challenge is the process of growing and trying to achieve the goal with a clear goal. I always thought about and practiced what would be related to the goal in order to improve from now on. Representatively, I was able to approach my goal of being a Back-End developer by gaining experience in internship, IT club, hackathon, etc. During the four-month internship period, I decided to intern because I wanted to know deeply about Back-End. While carrying out related training and projects, I was able to do various projects related to RESTful API and Spring. In the case of Spring, it was difficult because it was my first learning skill, but through books and internet lectures, I learned and practiced the Front Controller pattern, AOP and DI, and became interested in it. Since then, I have developed my Back-End skills by working on projects such as ""SFTP File Transmission/Reception Process Construction"" and ""Approval History Inquiry System"". As such, I grew through internship and I was able to get closer to my goal. Even after joining the company, I will develop my S/W development skills by challenging not only Back-End, but also cloud, large database, and Front-End. I will be a Back-End developer who can contribute to the development of applications to Hanwha S&C. I have experience in strengthening the solidarity of the team by exerting a sense of responsibility. When I was working in the development club, the project schedule was disrupted due to the personal circumstances of two team members. Since it was my first club activity at the time, I had a sense of responsibility to complete the project. Thus, in addition to my original role, Back-End development, I was in charge of Android development. Although I had no experience, I thought this would also be my asset, and I spared no sleep to meet the schedule. Seeing myself like this, my team members also completed their tasks even in difficult situations, and as a result, I was selected as an excellent team within the club. Through this, I built more trust with my team members and was able to proceed with the project together to this day. I will become a member of Hanwha S&C who can add vitality to the team with a sense of responsibility for the work I always take charge of. I have experienced difficulty in carrying out team projects in the wrong way of collaboration, ""not doing it separately."" From this experience, I learned that considering and solving problems together is one of the important factors of collaboration. At the time of the team project, there was a setback in the schedule due to the team member in charge of Back-End. It was because it was difficult to implement the algorithm due to the large number of exceptions. When we all thought about the problem together, we came up with an algorithm surprisingly easily. If we had thought about the problem together from the beginning, our team would have been able to complete the project within the schedule. From this experience, I learned that real collaboration is to do the best of the individual's task and to think about and solve the problem with the team members. I challenged myself with greed to do it alone, but I couldn't come up with a proper idea, but I was able to solve it with the help of my team members. From this experience, I realized that it is important to trust and actively communicate with your team members when you have difficulties. I gained job experience through ""job experience"" interns, IT clubs, OOOs, seminars, etc. Based on this experience, I will quickly adapt to work and be put into practice to contribute. Through this experience, I learned Java, Python language, frameworks such as Spring, and Django, AWS cloud technology, and shape management tools such as Git, SVN, etc. In addition to the technical aspects, I have experienced writing documents, meetings, code reviews, and communication with other occupations, so I am confident that I will be able to integrate quickly into Hanwha S&C's development organization. While working on my ""growth potential"" personal project, I constantly tried to improve my development skills by refactoring. We mainly perform refactoring in terms of improving code object-oriented or applying newly learned technologies such as AWS. For example, I have experienced refactoring the 'department bulletin board notification' in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, ORM, RESTful API, module separation, and AWS. I have tried to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Even after joining the company, I will not only organize my learning knowledge, but I will continue to grow as an S/W developer who can contribute to S&C by improving my development skills by applying it to personal projects. ""Innovation always exists around."" I think creative thinking is the most important thing at this point when ordinary companies are becoming digital transformation. We will be able to survive in the future market only when we create new business models by adding general industries and IT and have ICT technology. Therefore, creative thinking is based on Convergence IT, so I think it is an essential competency. I have experience in creating clothes search machines that combine artificial intelligence with existing shopping malls by participating in OOO. In general shopping malls, the only way to find the clothes you want is to search for keywords or find them yourself. However, I thought that if I could find clothes by image, it could give users a better experience. As a result, we developed the 'Clothes Search' using Microsoft's Cognitive API, and as a result, we were able to win the Excellence Award by tying for second out of 15 teams. Just as we carried out a project that can provide innovative convenience by incorporating artificial intelligence into the common shopping mall industry, I would like to cultivate Hanwha S&C's Convergence IT through continuous research in various fields."
"In high school, I became interested in the information security job after being hacked a few times because I was ignorant of security. As I entered the university with the OOO department, I learned what kind of work I was doing by subdividing the information security work, and I applied for the information security work because I thought that checking system vulnerabilities fits well with my meticulous and planned personality. The necessary competency in my opinion is the ability to use the understanding of new vulnerability information and related knowledge to check the in-house system. I have built up the foundation through my major study to understand various vulnerability information. I can be confident that my understanding of majors such as system security, network security, big data application security, security control, and mobile security, which I have studied and presented in the last two years, is higher than that of others. Among them, in the subject of Mobilesw Security, there was a time to research and present about mobile vulnerability checklists one part at a time, and I was in charge of the subject of Buffer Overflow. After that, I went out as an intern at a security company for two months as an on-the-job training, and based on my presentation, I had the experience of analyzing how to actually be exported from a weak application called Easy RM to MP3 Converter. In addition, I am currently studying to obtain an information security industry engineer license in order to acquire more practical knowledge, not just the experience of obtaining an information processing engineer license and studying the department. In the future, it is said that due to the 4th Industrial Revolution, not only fast delivery using drone delivery, but also 3D printers will be placed at consumers' homes and products that customers need can be manufactured and used at the same time as ordering. I want to become an expert in charge of CJ O Shopping's security by being able to acquire knowledge of vulnerabilities and wireless network security due to the development of IoT and AI, and respond to attacks using new technologies. When I took a course called Big Data Application Security, I worked on a team project for a little more than a month. The theme was a technique simulation to track ip spoofing, and in the process, it was divided into four parts: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena. At that time, it was divided into three teams by random drawing, but compared to other teams, our team was not passionate and was working hard only on the part that we were in charge of like an individual project. Looking at the overall flow, it was judged that the final result would be very low in completion and would not receive good grades at this rate. It was my role to analyze the correlation between ip headers using R, but after finishing that part, I organized the ip tracback technique, executed the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to inform the team members of the wrong point, read the data to be presented by other team members in advance, and advised them to fix it. As a result of such active efforts, other team members have also activated and cooperated in group chat rooms. As a result of the team project, I was able to get good grades, and I was able to feel proud when I heard indirectly from other team members that it was good to see that they were working hard. Until I worked on this project, I was not the type to be active and lead in the team at all. Until now, the experience of overcoming the limitations was that I had made efforts to improve myself, but through this experience, I was able to overcome my passive attitude and lead all of my team members to participate, so it was the most impressive experience to overcome the limitations."
"Due to the recent Fourth Industrial Revolution, the general public's interest in IT has increased, and various new technologies have emerged. Among them, smart products using AI home appliances, IoT, and robots may be LG's biggest competitiveness. When I was taking an IoT platform security class as an undergraduate of security, I researched about LG's IoT security strategy. It has been found that LG Electronics operates the 'LG Electronics Always Security Vulnerability Analysis Center' to create its own vulnerability checklist and conduct mock hacking. As I learned about system, network, and application vulnerabilities and encountered security incidents, I thought that creating and checking vulnerability checklist and checking system safety fit well with my meticulous and planned personality, so I applied. I want to apply in the security field. While attending the Department of Cybersecurity, I tried to maintain my grades in the top 30 percent by completing IT major class such as computer structure, computer network, database, and algorithm, and security major class such as system security, network security, big data application security, security control, and mobile security. In the system security class, we conducted a project to hook system call using language c. I received a close perfect score by hooking a function called sys_clone to improve the phenomenon that the system dies when the fork() function is called indefinitely in user mode. In network security, I have experience in creating a program in which the client and server communicate securely using a hybrid encryption system using language c. In the big data application security class, I received high scores by analyzing the correlation between fields using ip header data of large logs using R and conducting a team project that simulates the ip tracback technique using Arena. In the security control class, I have experience in creating detection rules using IPS, IDS, DDX equipment of real security companies and practicing whether virtual DoS attacks are actually detected. In the mobile security class, I was able to learn 26 criteria for software security weaknesses through the mobile public service security weakness check guide provided by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs. Based on this, I have experience in creating buffer overflows in real vulnerable applications when I went on a field trip to a company. I want to work on LG's IoT security. According to the Future Promising Technology Research Institute in 2017, the smart home appliance sector, which LG is increasing its investment, is one of the areas of living environment that will emerge over the next 10 years. In other words, it means that new security incidents could occur in the smart home appliance sector over the next 10 years. Right after joining the company, I would like to check the equipment, networks, and systems established in-house and make sure that the security vulnerability inspection guidelines provided by the Financial Security Agency, the Ministry of Government Administration and Security, and Kisa are being followed. In addition, we will prepare for security incidents that may occur by diligently learning about IoT services and smart home appliances being prepared by LG. To do so, we will study IoT equipment, wireless environment, and embedded Linux and prepare by introducing secure lightweight encryption and authentication technology. In addition, I want to become a talented person who can be harmonized with future business by frequently accessing new security trends and papers related to new technologies and attending security-related seminars."
"""Energetic applicant"" I am a bright and sociable applicant. My mother influenced me greatly in the way I formed my personality. My mother ran a piano academy, so my house was always full of friends my age. After my mother finished her class, I spent time with my friends, playing ddokji and ddakji. I naturally grew up to be a bright and sociable personality. My hobby is bowling. I enjoy bowling every two times a month. When I have a hard day, I step to the bowling alley with excitement that 'Bowling will relieve all of my fatigue.' As expected, with the falling pins, I feel the stress from the past is relieved at once. ""Collaboration, my own growth DNA."" My growth DNA is 'collaboration.' While engaged in outdoor activities with different team members and working as an intern for the first time as a social experience, I felt that 'the power of collaboration is greater than that of an excellent person.' Since then, I have been practicing collaboration by using collaboration as my growth DNA. By collaborating on the 'Improving the Course Application System' project, I received 7th place in the interim evaluation and 2nd place in the final evaluation. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind when the team member who was PM due to early employment was neglected. Judging that the final result would not be produced within the period if the team member was overlooked, I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member. As a result, I was able to get the second place result in the final evaluation, which was a whopping five steps higher than the interim evaluation. Even after joining Hansol Intcube, I will continue to work together to share and lead the difficulties of my colleagues to create results. ""Fruit 'Challenge' with the root of 'Teamwork' When I worked as OOO supporters, I tried the challenge of changing the venue to a downtown area and achieved a 200% increase in participants based on the teamwork. Skin Food Supporters have been promoting new products at selected universities. The target of the existing event was a university student. Judging that the main purchasing group was not limited to college students, I suggested moving the venue to a downtown area and expanding our target. This innovative idea was accepted, and we held an event in Myeongdong under the concept of the hit movie ""The Avengers."" The event, which was organized with the team members from one to ten, such as selecting a place, designing, and purchasing items, ended with a great response from about 250 people. Due to the solid roots of ""teamwork,"" we were able to safely wrap up the event within the schedule despite a sudden change of venue. With this teamwork, we will produce countless ""challenges"" at Hansol Int'Cube. I had the experience of failing in a contest where I challenged myself under the theme of ""People with Open Ears"" and ""Provisions for 5G-based Connected Cars."" As everyone was greedy to win the competition, they couldn't help but disagree and spent nearly three weeks deciding on the topic. As a result, we had to hold overnight meetings one week before the submission period due to disruptions to our schedule. In the end, we failed to produce highly completed results and experienced the bitter pain of losing the match. Through this experience, I realized the importance of listening to and gathering the opinions of the other person. I will become an open-eared member of Hansol Int'Cube. ""Secondhand auction site made by myself"" The final project to train SW engineers was developed. The goal of the project was to develop a site where you can purchase used items at the price you want. For safe transactions, which is the main focus, I planned a 'manager virtual account' that temporarily manages the amount deposited by the buyer until the buyer receives the item, and an e-mail authentication and mobile phone authentication process. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, information modification, withdrawal, and login, and membership event functions. When I clicked the email authentication button, I searched the MEMBER table through AJAX to check whether it was duplicated or not, and if there was no email, I sent the authentication number. Mobile phone authentication used Open API. Membership was graded based on the number of transactions in the last three months. Transactions that are past three months were deleted from the AUCTION table, and the company used Quartz technology to readjust the rating every day on the first day of each month. Since three of the four team members were non-majors, we studied for one hour every day to overcome the limitations of the knowledge we encountered. I conducted personal learning through Toby's Spring book and Googling, and absorbed what I learned while working on the study. As a result, I received positive reviews that the site was well-implemented enough to be sold to the instructor right away. I gained three things from this experience. First, it is the practical experience of IT, second, the power of teamwork, and third, the attitude of working on development from the user's perspective. Now, I will show all of these at Hansol Int'Cube. ""Innovative Workers who will entertain the world with Hansol Int'Cube"" With the experience of various projects, they have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to their mined technology. For example, we proposed a central inventory management system by showing creativity in the 'Improving Inventory Management System for Large Clothing Stores' project. When using online clothing stores, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. Since it is difficult to link the order information DB and the inventory DB in real time, we decided that it was not difficult for companies to do so. To solve this problem, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government by store. In order to differentiate it from the existing system, we added a function that recommends stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. As a result, there was a lot of admiration among the students about how they could come up with this idea, and I enjoyed the joy of winning first place in the creativity category along with the favorable reviews of the professor in charge of the innovative system that can be sold right away.In order to deliver a true impression to customers by competing with various existing IT services, I think creativity must be added to the service. With IT services based on creative thinking, we are ready to support Hansol IntiCube, an IT company that has more than 15 years of know-how in the field of contact center and wireless Internet solutions. Hansol IntiCube will become an Innovative Worker that can be the cornerstone for pioneering new digital content markets. ""Co-growth with Hansol IntiCube"" I supported the growth of Hansol IntiCube, which is growing into the top professional company in the IT solution field. I want to achieve joint growth at Hansol IntiCube, which strives to become a mature company where 'customers', 'shareholders', and 'employees' can be satisfied, grow, and contribute to society together. In order to perform SW development work at Hansol IntiCube, we have an understanding of business and development capabilities. In order to clearly reflect users' needs in SW, they must have an understanding of the business they run. I have learned methodologies such as object orientation and CBD by working on various projects that combine IT and business, such as 'How to build a smart factory using cloud computing' and 'Improving inventory management systems for clothing stores'. I have developed the ability to understand users' businesses by expressing systems that reflect requirements in modeling languages such as use cases, ERD, and DFD. Development capabilities are required in order to develop software that is easy to use and easy to expand functions. I developed my development capabilities by conducting development projects for 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site' based on the Spring Framework in the Applied SW Engineer Training. In addition, I acquired a SQL Developer Certification for SW development considering not only the accuracy of data but also its usability, and developed my SQL writing capabilities. By demonstrating the capabilities I have learned, I will achieve customer satisfaction and shared growth with Hansol Inticube as the first-class quality."

A+ # 2017 Capstone Design 1 ? A+ * Developers who don't know about giving up."" Last July, I participated in the hackathon and realized the importance of the spirit of challenge. We didn't have enough time because we had to create the perfect program in about 30 hours. Our team had a hard time planning the idea, but decided to develop a program that can find clothes with images. Since the existing method of finding clothes with keywords has difficulty in expressing unstructured thoughts, we developed a 'Clothes Search' to find clothes faster and more accurately. My role was to develop REST API using Vision API and image crawling for early data learning. During the development process, we had difficulties in learning images. Vision API works based on tags. So, when you learn an image, you have to insert a specific tag together. It was inefficient for developers to allocate all tags of more than 1000 images directly, so we had to find an efficient way. We found a way to obtain tags for images by analyzing Vision API and tried to apply it, but we needed a separate identifier called Tag ID to learn. We solved the problem by analyzing the API again to get the ID of the tag. At first, I thought it would not be possible to implement it. However, after analyzing the API without giving up, we were able to find a way to learn images. As a result, we were able to create a program that worked perfectly, and our team received an 'Excellent Award'. From this experience, I learned that the attitude to challenge without giving up is important. Even after joining the company, there will be many situations where the roles given to me are technically difficult. However, I will solve the problem by analyzing related technologies with the spirit of challenge as I am now."
"I majored in 'industrial engineering' and wanted to study various disciplines in related fields when I was a junior at university, so I chose 'design engineering' as my minor and completed it together. Industrial engineering is a study that designs and manages the production environment and systems of the entire industry to be optimized. I learned the ability to design and develop SW programs through C and C++ languages, and to handle data with SPSS and R programs based on my knowledge of statistics. After two years of accumulating basic knowledge of industrial engineering, I wanted to challenge a wider range of academic fields by incorporating design engineering, so I took design methodology and creative capstone design courses. When I first took the design course, I was not only inferior to the existing design engineering students, but I was also not able to handle design tools properly, and I was worried that my lack of knowledge would hurt other friends who were doing team-specific tasks, so I studied harder than them by attending the design tool academy after school. In addition, I suggested how to use sensors while designing apps or smart devices using various engineering knowledge, and I contributed to the team by using my own strengths by suggesting interfaces with knowledge of ergonomics and UX. As a result, I got excellent grades in almost all design subjects. After graduating from college, I went to the Department of Computer Systems at the OOO Technical School and studied computer hardware and software programming. I obtained six computer-related certificates in one year, and I was selected as an excellent student and even went to Taiwan to train. When I was a senior at university, I served as the team leader for a year preparing for my graduation work. The theme of my graduation work in the subject of 'Industrial Engineering Capstone Design' was 'Selecting the Location of a Hub for Optimization of Blood Logistics'. To this end, I decided to collect the necessary data and use the R program to create a cluster of hospitals and produce PPTs. So, I shared the work by considering the strengths and circumstances of the team members, and a friction occurred between the class who collected the data and the class who produced the PPT while the work was progressing by exerting their abilities. The class who collected the data was that the PPT content was poor compared to the effort he made, and the class who produced the PPT was also hurt his pride because his efforts were not recognized. As a leader, I listened to them enough, and I conveyed to each other that there was a misunderstanding because I wanted to perform a task well even in a busy situation. At that time, I had time to finish my part, and I organized materials with my two classmates and supplemented the PPT and submitted my graduation work. Despite the trial and error, our team was selected as the outstanding team on campus and won the Silver Award at the SCM competition for Korean college students as a result of making concessions and respecting each other toward their goals. I was once a person who was 'generous to others and strict to me'. I learned that being considerate of others is a virtue, but not loving myself, my very minor problems made me feel constrained and intimidated. So I tried to control my mind by reading self-development books and humanities books. Meanwhile, I learned how to do 'artist date'. 'artist date' was once a week, by walking around the neighborhood or spending at least an hour doing what I wanted to do, or riding a bicycle to visit a library, an art museum, or a flower market to refresh my mood and take a rest. As a result, my stubborn mind softened, my thoughts became flexible, and I came to think creatively and variously. At that time, I was burdened with my studies by choosing a multi-major, and I had less confidence compared to other design engineering majors, but through ""Artist Date,"" I looked back on myself, saw and felt various things around me, and gained a little confidence. As a result, I was able to participate more actively in my studies by generating ideas freely in class, and above all, I came to be more considerate of others with a more sincere heart than before. As a sincere and creative talent who majored in industrial engineering and design engineering, I want to join Ko Young Technology's SMT inspection equipment software development department to research and develop inspection solutions and technologies. I can make desired programs using C language and C++ language, which are the basis of software development, and I have the ability to find meaningful statistics from data to reduce defect rates and find suitable solutions. In addition, I am confident that my idea of recognizing problems, seeking and attempting to find various solutions resembles the innovation of Ko Young Technology, which developed the world's first 3D AOI (part-mounted inspection device), which can contribute to the improvement and development of technology. Innovation is based on the basics and trust. Through vocational training, I have learned the basic principles of computers and soldering techniques step by step, and I think that the sharpness of meticulous observation of even the smallest parts is the basic and trust of precise technology, and this trust grows a company. If I join Ko Young Technology, I will continue to study actively and look at equipment and algorithms in new ways. I will understand the characteristics and core technologies of the equipment, understand them accurately, and suggest more precise and innovative technologies from a new perspective while listening to the advice of seniors. In 10 years, I will grow up to be a person who researches and manages the entire process from SW development of equipment to UX planning."
"The most important values in choosing a ""company that can grow and contribute"" are 'contribution' and 'growth potential'. I see if there is anything I can contribute to the company and if I can grow through the company. In this respect, I thought it was a great fit when I looked at the Zoom Internet. I have built up my Java Back-End development skills through experiences such as internships and development clubs. In particular, the experience of developing a new writing notification system through crawling, which was conducted as a personal project, will be the most helpful in understanding and performing tasks. In addition, development using MySQL and Python (Django) was also carried out in the club activities. Experiences like these will help you quickly acquire the knowledge you need for work. I think learning ability is important because there are many things to learn. When you learn the development stack that you use in the past more deeply and specifically than new things, you will be able to learn with much more pleasure and actively to achieve great efficiency. I was convinced that Zoom Internet is a company that values talented people and has an active communication culture. I think that thinking about talented people gives employees a sense of pride and responsibility, and communication enables co-prosperity. In this respect, I think Zoom Internet is a company with potential for growth. I saw an article during the job posting that said, 'It would be even better if you read these books and apply.' Recommend books to new developers in the future can be considered that you value people and the communication culture is activated. Therefore, I decided to apply for Zoom Internet as a company that can grow as a developer and be proud of itself, and become a developer who always dreams of developing in an atmosphere of communication. The advantage is that I have a strong sense of responsibility for ""responsibility in collaboration."" I think responsibility is essential in collaboration. I believe that the synergy of the team is further strengthened when performed responsibly for common tasks. I have experience of strengthening the solidarity of the team by exerting responsibility. When I was working in the development club 000, the project schedule was disrupted due to the personal circumstances of the team members. Since it was my first club activity at the time, I had a sense of responsibility to complete the project. Thus, I was in charge of Android development in addition to my original role, Back-End development. Although I had no experience, I thought this would also be an asset, and I spared no sleep to meet the schedule. Seeing this, the team members also completed their tasks even in difficult situations, and as a result, they were selected as the excellent team within the club. As a result, I built more trust with the team members and was able to proceed and complete the project together after the club activities. I will become a member of the Zoom Internet, which can always add vitality to the team with a sense of responsibility for my duties. The disadvantage is that I perform endlessly with a ""endless spirit of challenge."" I tend to neglect other tasks because I am busy doing what is in front of me. For example, when I was working on a personal project, I found an exception while writing the bulletin board crawling logic. The next day, I have an experience that I completely forgot that I had a class in the first period and struggled all night to solve that exception. Eventually, I couldn't concentrate on the class throughout the first period. As such, I always do my best in the immediate work, but I often go too far. However, I am trying to fix it by checking in advance what to do the next day and making a time plan. Through thorough time management, I will try to become a member of the Zoom Internet, which does not make mistakes in the second-ranked work. When I solved problems and improved the inconvenience of life through the software development of ""No. 1 Back-End Developers"", I felt proud and proud when I learned new skills and refactored them. Looking back on my undergraduate days, I showed the greatest concentration in problem-solving programming, project execution, and learning of new development knowledge, and it was interesting. Therefore, the software development job is the most suitable job and the job that I want to reach its peak. I want to grow as a Back-End development expert in the Back-End development team. When I was in second grade, I first learned web programming and became interested, so I aimed to become a Back-End developer by studying Spring Framework myself from JSP/Servlet. It has come to me as an attractive way to write business logic and provide APIs within the program. Interns and development club activities helped me the most in achieving my goals among the experiences I have tried so far. Working as an intern in charge of Back-End development, I learned the basics of Back-End development. In one month of job training, I learned the knowledge of Back-End and developed my Back-End development skills by using UML design, work process writing, collaboration with client developers, SVN, Jenkins, etc. It was an experience that I challenged myself because I wanted to learn clearly in practice and grow through feedback, not by myself. Along with the development of Back-End development, it became an opportunity to further increase interest and interest. In addition to this experience, I was convinced that Back-End was the most suitable development field for me, considering personality, interest, and aptitude. In that respect, the Chrome platform development job of the Zoom Internet is the job I want to challenge the most. I will become an S/W developer who can grow and contribute as a Back-End developer while developing a crawl platform. I gained job experience through ""job experience"" interns, IT clubs, hackathon, seminars, etc. Based on this experience, I am confident that I will quickly learn and contribute to my work. With this experience, I learned Java, Python language and framework, AWS, and Git, etc. In addition to the technical aspects, I have experienced document writing, meetings, and code reviews, so I am confident that I will learn better and do well in developing a crawl platform than anyone else. I tried to improve my development skills by constantly refactoring my ""led growth"" personal projects.Refactoring is performed mainly in the aspect of improving code or applying newly learned technologies in an object-oriented manner. For example, I have experience repactoring personal project 000 in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, REST API, etc. I have been trying to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Even after joining the company, I will not just organize the knowledge I learn, but I will continue to grow as a software developer who can contribute to the Zoom Internet by improving my development skills by applying it to personal projects."
"Recently, I have been playing C.A.T.S. and FIFA Online 3M as mobile games. I have been enjoying playing FIFA Online 3M very much because it is linked to the PC version, but my current level is 92. C.A.T.S. is a game in which tanks are customized to fight against each other. It is currently up to the 14th stage of the championship. As for PC games, I often enjoy League of Legends and Starcraft, which is emerging again these days. Also, I am playing FIFA Online 3 that is linked to mobile the most. The job I applied for is game QA. Anyway, first of all, you have to understand and know the game well. I have encountered many kinds of games since I was young. I think this is advantageous for work compared to people who do not know the game well, because I have encountered almost everything I have done evenly. Second, I have worked on smart TV QA at an S/W testing company for about a year, and I think one of the things I felt during that period is persistence. Another important point in QA is persistence. I think QA work is a random bug, so there are tests that have to be repeated countless times. I think it is important to be patient when conducting such a test. Third is creativity. When I was doing QA work in my entire company, I often found bugs that other people didn't see. I used to get compliments from colleagues around me, and I think that's because creativity was shown. The most common nagging thing was to clean your room. But I think I always keep order in chaos, which is chaos. I have my own rules, and I always leave things in a convenient place to find. But anyway, I know that this is not good for others. So, I think that order in chaos is important, but also order in the outside is important, so I always keep thinking to myself to be organized well. If I can't remember exactly what kind of game it is, there was a mobile game I used to enjoy a lot in the past. I used to pay cash to recharge my heart, but it never came in properly. I always had to contact the customer center after I made the payment, and the heart came in. But it's not like that once, and every time I paid, I was really angry and asked, expressing anger at the inquiry. But the answer that came back was just a macro answer. If I were a service provider, I would judge that errors in cash payments are quite a big error, and I would sincerely apologize to customers and would not respond in a copy-and-paper manner. I think that kind of service is the shortcut to ruining the game. When I think of Nexon Networks, the word youth comes to mind first. I don't know exactly, but I heard that there are many young people, and when I came across them through various articles and game sites, I saw almost a lot of young people. I think youth is really important. I think the atmosphere of the company can change and there is a spirit of youth, so I want to join the spirit of youth. What I have experienced while working in QA is mainly in the broadcasting channel or TV field. Through this internship, I also experienced QA work in the game industry, and I look forward to working hard to be reborn as a regular employee. In my life, I have rarely had any problems because I always deal with interpersonal relationships in a leisurely manner. I have always maintained good interpersonal relationships because I think from the other person's point of view and try not to be offended. However, just as trouble will happen even if I stay still, sometimes the problem occurs, and in this case, I solve the problem by making a concession. If you're a person who gets into trouble with me, there's nothing good for each other when they bump into each other, so I think the best option is to just make concessions and say good things. When I was in college, I was planning and producing an automatic gas valve lock as my graduation work. However, I got a job when I was halfway through my work around summer vacation, and I went out for a job. At that time, I felt sorry for my friend who was working with me in groups of two. Fortunately, however, I felt a little relaxed because he also got a job, but I was able to come up with a more complete work by meeting him during my free time to raise the completeness of 50% to 80%. At this time, I thought that I could do everything I realized. I wondered if I could do well while I was busy, but anyway, I was satisfied and realized that I worked together with my friend to achieve better results."
"""Finding a business model through strategy and execution."" ""Strategic execution, strategy in action"" I think these are the words necessary for a company to grow. I think the current growth of Midas IT is also based on strategy and execution. We set Midas' own principles for growth and created our own spirit that must be equipped for the realization of core values and visions, and based on them, we established a systematic five-step work procedure. I think this strategy, which minimizes problems that arise in the process of performing tasks and increases the sense of belonging of employees, can serve as the cornerstone for the company's growth. If you have prepared enough strategies and foundations to enhance the work performance of your employees, I think you should establish a business strategy based on them and discover a business model that can make profits. Midas' business areas can be divided into software, engineering consulting, and e-Biz business. In the introduction of core technologies, there is an introduction saying, ""With our own technologies, we are informing the world of the excellence of Korean engineering technologies."" As such, the strategy of all business departments developing and selling core technologies without importing them from abroad has been so farI think it has become the foundation for SU to succeed. Companies with core technologies believe that their technologies can have infinite potential to grow into trees as their roots. For example, Alibaba in China is also expanding its scope to various fields such as cloud, fintech, and securities based on a service called an e-commerce platform. As in this case, I think Midas also created a business model based on the core technologies developed by himself. As a result, I think the foundation of Midas' growth was that he established the strategy of the company on which it was based and implemented it to develop core technologies. ""I am a developer with '○○'. ""As I have grown as a developer, I have a principle to become a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I have to possess as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is most necessary no matter what I perform. During my startup activities, I learned related technologies for 14 hours a day to learn Android technologies that I do not know well for app development. As a result, I showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete a task within such a given time, it is necessary to perform additional tasks as needed and return one's own time to learn skills, so I have grown up with the principle of becoming a responsible developer. ""The current energy production of passionate power plants is 50%."" I think those who plan and strategize software businesses need the same ability as power plants to challenge themselves with passion like power plants that generate electricity and to analyze market problems with a cool-headed gaze like a cooler. The passion that does not neglect anything has become the driving force to completely digest the contest, external activities, internship, and volunteer activities. Even if the contest fails by challenging with the spirit of the lacquerware, the suspicious contests came up with new ideas and proposed after the contest, the start-up activities that have been steadily conducted for nearly two years to identify market trends and learn S/W development skills, and the internship activities of researchers who presented a new paradigm that was not present in the existing market through medical and IT convergence are all the results of my efforts to sincerely carry out various activities with the enthusiasm for new challenges. Among them, the contest, which I challenged without giving up more than 20 times for the award, gave me an opportunity to grow my passionate power plant to the next level. I analyzed problems such as proposals and designs for ideas that were not awarded, not just supporting the contest."
"""The Future City Built with IBS"" Lotte Information and Communication has abundant experience in the field of intelligent building systems (IBS) and is leading the construction of smart buildings. Various IBS solutions have been developed that can provide a convenient environment to customers by integrating them with IOT technologies such as central control system, building energy management system, U-healthcare, smart card, and smart parking system. Recently, it has established an energy-saving system (LEMS) in conjunction with the IOT platform at the Busan Metropolitan Government Complex, and is expanding its business areas of IBS such as domestic and international complexes, shopping malls, hotels, and apartments. My goal is to develop convenient services for people by using IOT technology. Furthermore, it is my big dream to build a future city that is automatically controlled without much effort from people, and I think it is a must-have task in the future business. And I am confident that I can achieve my dream by building a future city through the accumulated IBS technology of Lotte Information and Communication. ""The path of a developer"" Since I was young, I have dreamed of becoming a developer following my father, who is a computer programmer. However, when I entered the computer department, I didn't know anything about development. I realized that making a computer program while listening to my major was not an easy task, so I went to the military after passing the first grade. Before returning to school after discharge, I learned my failed experiences in my freshman year and first came to see my friends who are studying in my major and made a commitment to improve my programming skills. In order to strengthen the basics step by step, I learned theories by watching internet lectures from C programming. The more I learned, the more I became interested in programming, and I wanted to learn other languages. I studied JAVA programming, C++ STL, and data structure programming by myself, and after the leave of absence period was over, I returned to school. When I applied the subjects I learned by myself according to the professor's professional education, my understanding became better, and in the first semester after returning to school, I was able to get A+ grades in all subjects. I applied for an intern because I wanted to apply my capabilities as a developer, and I learned various major programming skills such as network and data communication. The TSB software development department of Daegu Technopark worked on optimization of the system measurement algorithm and conversion of the development language. While working on the joint project, I was able to develop a sense of cooperation in the organization and the ability to communicate with my team members. I think I can successfully complete the project if I use my cooperation and communication skills in Lotte Information and Communication. I worked as a serving and barista for two years in a restaurant called ""Consideration and Responsibility Learned by Part-time Jobs"". Since I had no experience working part-time before, I didn't get used to my work, and I made many mistakes, so I was often scolded by the boss. I thought about whether serving was inappropriate for me, and I thought about whether I should find another job. However, I had a motto not to give up on anything, so I decided to do it until I could. As time passed, I became better at serving, and I became able to become a barista as a dessert business proficient. Among the part-timers I worked with, when I became the best, the boss, who was scolding me at first, began to acknowledge it, and I took charge of the manager who manages the restaurant part-timers. As I became a manager, I began to feel a sense of responsibility as a manager. Previously, I did what I was told to do, but when I was told to do the work, I learned that I had to take responsibility for it. I started to act independently in everything in the restaurant like my own store, and I came to think about how to satisfy the service for customers who came to the restaurant. I introduced the recommended menu to customers who came for the first time, and for customers who came often, I tried to listen to the customer's hard work by recognizing the menu first and asking them in advance what they ate often. I started to have regular customers who came on purpose because they liked my service, and I felt the joy and reward of working. The mind of caring for customers first was applied throughout my daily life, and I was always considerate when I met people. ""I didn't give up and overcame my weaknesses through various attempts."" I was embarrassed by an unexpected problem, but I had an experience of overcoming it. At the embedded research center in the school, I formed a team with my friends and participated in the IOT project contest. As a detailed theme of the project, I conducted a project called 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycle Cluster'. It was a project to autonomously maintain the distance between bicycles through Arduino signals after measuring the distance between bicycles with a mobile phone GPS during the platooning of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while I was developing the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. I thought a lot about solving the problem, but I came to the conclusion that it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge I knew. However, if the speed control function could not be implemented, the project could not proceed, so I couldn't give up. So, I tried various attempts to solve the problem. I contacted the company of the electric bicycle I purchased and tried to obtain information on the electronic circuit diagram of the electric bicycle. By analyzing the electronic circuit diagram and sending the signal by directly connecting it to the throttle and brake control part of the Arduino and electric bicycle, I was able to finally complete the project by successfully adjusting the speed of the electric bicycle. Taking this experience as a foothold, if I face an unexpected problem in the course of the project, I will not give up and try from various perspectives. So, I will do my best to solve the problem without fail. ""The future city built with IBS of Lotte Information and Communication"" We will apply IBS to all buildings of Lotte affiliates, and further contribute to the construction of a future city applied with IBS technology of Lotte Information and Communication.To this end, I will learn various IBS solutions that accumulate the know-how of Lotte Information and Communication and the LEMS system linked with the IOT platform at the beginning of joining the company. And I will try to become a developer who communicates with team members. In 5 years, I will try to understand the needs of customers and develop necessary IBS solutions. And as IOT technology develops, we will establish a security solution that becomes more important to prepare for hacking and malicious programs. In 10 years, as the project manager, I will do optimization work to build an efficient IBS system. I am confident that the establishment of an IBS future city will be the stepping stone for Lotte Information and Communication's globalization, and I also want to achieve my dream of building a future city that becomes more convenient for people."

The IBS system is also applied to Lotte World Tower, which is recently scheduled to open, and Lotte Information and Communication's IBS technology will be applied to more buildings in the future. I dream to build a future city that is automatically controlled without much effort by people, using IOT technology, and I think it is a must-have task in the future business. I want to achieve my dream by building a future city by utilizing the accumulated IBS technology after joining Lotte Information and Communication.

After that, I learned various major subjects such as network and data communication, and I grew as a developer, and I interned to learn programming that was practically applied in the company. The software development team of Total Softbank carried out a joint project to optimize the system measurement algorithm and convert the development language. While working on the joint project, I learned how to communicate and cooperate with my team members. I will try to successfully carry out the project using my cooperation and communication skills in Lotte Information and Communication.

"I recommend the above student to be an intern at your university. OOO students have excellent academic performance and perform faithfully with responsibility for their duties. And they have good teamwork skills. As a result, when I carried out the graduation project, I cooperated well with my team members and received the Excellence Award at the SW Convergence Project Performance Presentation. I also have various internship experiences. I worked on algorithm conversion and UI design revision for 2 months at Total Softbank Company, interned at the Embedded Software Research Center for 3 months, detected and tested errors in the ESL electronic price indicator system, and developed the V2X in-school vehicle safety system server. Based on the following experiences, I recommend you to do well as an intern at your university.

Currently, I am studying with an emphasis on web development and am working on a project linked to Mysql DB using JavaScript. Based on this, I would like to contribute to the establishment and operation of the management information system, appraisal and compensation management system of the Korea Appraisal Board."
"I have a personality of being considerate of the other person and a spirit of challenge that does not give up. ""Don't give up and challenge."" My life value is 'Let's not give up in any difficulties'. I participated in the IOT competition under the theme of 'Electric Bicycle Cluster Self-Driving'. While smoothly working on the project, a problem occurred due to the compatibility of Arduino and electric bicycles. I thought a lot about it to solve the problem, but it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge I knew. However, I did not give up and tried to solve the problem. I contacted the electric bicycle company I bought to get information about the electronic circuit diagram, and I was able to complete the project by sending signals to the control part of the electric bicycle directly through Arduino. Taking this experience as an opportunity, I came to have 'Let's not give up' as a value and I gained confidence that I can solve any adversity I face in the future. 'Consideration for the other person' I always consider the other person when dealing with a person. I wasn't considerate personality from the beginning, but it changed when I was a manager at a restaurant for two years. I worked to entertain customers and tried to satisfy customers. We introduced the recommended menu to the first-time guests, and the frequent visitors asked in advance what they ate frequently, and we accepted the customer's efforts. As I worked while being considerate of the customers, I naturally came to be considerate of the other person. Being considerate of the other person helped me coordinate my opinions while working on a team project, and my sense of cooperation improved accordingly. I will contribute to achieving a common goal by demonstrating cooperation when working on a project at Hanwha System. ""Pride for National Security"" I think the defense industry is a key project that the state should invest in for the security of the country. Hanwha System is leading the defense industry of the country such as radar-electron optics, command and control and communication systems, and marine weapons systems. It is a leading company in the defense industry of Korea with accumulated know-how and superior technology in the field of precision electronics and software. I applied because I wanted to work with the pride and passion of protecting my family and the country by contributing to the improvement of future defense technology by taking charge of SW at Hanwha System. ""Effective system integration"" I will strive to improve the integration technology of the ship combat system. Hanwha System was selected in competition with LIG for the KF-X system AESA radar development project. I think Hanwha System's system integration technology is the competitiveness that is ahead of its competitor LIG. If I join Hanwha System's SW department, I will analyze the current system by receiving Hanwha System's accumulated know-how in system integration technology in the short term. And I will create Hanwha System that shows the status of No. 1 in the defense industry in Korea by establishing algorithms and communication systems that can be effectively applied to system integration in the long term. In order to develop SW capabilities, students can use C, C++, and JAVA languages through undergraduate major studies and projects, and they have developed various programming skills such as network. Algorithm, Linux programming, and Arduino programming. And I improved my working-level project skills through internship and contest. ""Efficient Server Establishment"" I worked as an intern at embedded research center and developed V2X in-school vehicle system servers. I researched for efficient server construction, and as a result, I built an IOCP-type server that is the most used in the game industry, the most efficient server. In order to build an IOCP server, I learned a lot of server network knowledge and also worked on tuning the MySQL database to increase server efficiency. And for practical network test, we developed the MFC program so that other people can test it easily. ""Cooperative spirit gained through the joint project"" I was the team leader in the graduation project of the regional leading project. I proceeded with a project to provide coupons using beacons to small business owners in Daehak-ro. As the team leader, I implemented a beacon recognition module and Android socket communication using beacon API with the project general manager. And as the team leader of the joint project, I made a lot of efforts to cooperate with other schools. While working on the joint project, I learned the importance of teamwork, and I was able to learn how to efficiently carry out the project with other teams for a common goal. I will also contribute to the smooth progress of the joint project by demonstrating my cooperative spirit in the Hanwha system."
"""No.1 LG Leaps to Smart Factory"" My dream is to develop technology and create a world where people become more convenient through less labor. That's why I became attracted to the smart factory industry, which increases cost reduction effect and facility utilization rate through factory automation. LG CNS has accumulated know-how in building factory automation for more than 20 years and leads the smart factory industry by building manufacturing execution solution (ezMES), facility control solution (ezControl), and integrated control solution (ezUMS). I think IOT is important for smart factory technology in preparation for the 4th industrial revolution. I made an effort to become an IOT expert. I worked on several projects using Arduino and Beacon, and learned sensor utilization technology by interning at the embedded lab. And to gain IOT knowledge, I acquired the IOT Knowledge Competency Test certificate. I will contribute to the LG CNS smart factory industry moving forward globally by utilizing my IOT technology. I once participated in a project contest organized by the embedded lab on campus as a team with my friends. The theme was 'Smart Bicycle Cluster Driving Using BLE Beacons', which measures the current location coordinates of electric bicycles and the distance between the bicycles through GPS and beacon correction algorithms and displays the location of the bicycles on the mobile phone application. Arduino implemented an automatic speed control function that slows down electric bicycles when the distance between bicycles is closer than the reference distance and increases speed when the distance increases. I interned at the institute during the 3rd grade winter vacation in recognition of my achievements after the completion of the project. I worked to build an IOCP server for the V2X school vehicle safety system and DB test and error detection for the ESL electronic price indicator system. While interning, I was able to learn how the system I actually built was managed and learn how to cooperate with my colleagues. ""Global No. 1 Smart Factory Company"" We will apply LG CNS's smart factory technology to all manufacturing industries in Korea and further contribute to LG CNS' global leap forward. And we will build our big data, cloud, and IOT technology capabilities so that the smart factory industry can move forward in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. First of all, I will try to experience and understand smart factory solutions such as ezMES and ezControl of LG CNS for three years after joining the company. And I will study whether it is possible to build a smart factory in other manufacturing fields other than the solar, automobile, and logistics fields where the current smart factory is established. In addition, I will study whether it can be applied to smart factory solutions by improving cloud and IOT technology capabilities in preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Ultimately, in 10 years, by applying the accumulated cloud and IOT technology capabilities, LG CNS smart factory solutions will overwhelm Germany's smart factory technology and contribute to becoming the No. 1 LG CNS in the world."
"""Be considerate before speaking"" I always want to live a caring life. When I meet people, I try to be in the other person's position and figure out what that person wants. And I catch up and act without asking for what the other person wants. By feeling rewarded by seeing the other person's gratitude, I become more motivated and considerate of the other person. I worked part-time at a restaurant cafe called ""Manager of a Restaurant"" for two years. As I took over as manager, I started to manage regular customers. I tried to feel that I was receiving special treatment by asking in advance what my regular customers eat often or providing service food. As a result, customer satisfaction in the restaurant has increased and my skills to entertain customers have also increased. ""Barista Certificate"" I want to obtain a certificate by taking a practical test for barista certificate. I tried to obtain a barista second-level certificate with the experience of learning coffee at a restaurant cafe. However, I only passed the written test and prepared for the practical test, but I did not. There is a lot of regret that I did not finish what I could finish, so I want to get a certificate and finish it. ""Easy Financial Transaction Services"" I think the biggest issue in the current financial sector is FinTech. Many shopping malls and other banks are investing a lot in Pintet. Among them, an application called Toss gave me a big impression. Previously, I couldn't make any financial transactions without an accredited certificate, but the advantage of being able to send money by just knowing the contact information of the other party was a fresh shock to me. Since then, I have had a wish to make simple and more convenient services for people who have difficulty in financial transactions on the Internet. ""Must-have services for customers"" Although the Toss application has grown significantly, KB Kookmin Bank customers still use KB Star Banking. I found that Kookmin Bank has also developed and provided a LIV platform for convenient services for customers. It is not just about remittance, but also provides currency exchange and waiting ticket issuance services for customers. I find out what services are essential from the customer's point of view and what needs improvement. KB Kookmin Bank would like to add essential services in LIV to get high satisfaction from Kookmin Bank customers. ""From Grade 4 to Grade 1,"" I got a grade 4 in the math category during the mock test in June, when I was in high school. While I was struggling with my grade improvement, I found that the standard score in the math area, which was predicted to be relatively difficult, was higher than that of other subjects. So I thought that focusing on studying rules in the math area could improve my grades efficiently. During the time that there is not much time left until the SAT, I set my goal for the first grade in the math area and set a strategy to improve my grades. First of all, in order to solve various problems, I bought all the repair workbooks sold on the market and invested more than 10 hours a day in problem solving. I tried to get help for problems I didn't know, but I made a wrong answer note and mastered it repeatedly. At first, my grades didn't improve, but I didn't give up and kept on studying. At some point, my grades began to rise little by little, and I finally got the grade of first grade in the SAT. Having achieved a high grade improvement from grade 4 to grade 1, I made it my life's motto that there is nothing I can't achieve if I don't give up and invest my time and passion to try. And when I have a task to solve, I have an attitude that I don't give up and try. I teamed up with my friends to participate in a project competition organized by a research institute in the school. The theme was to identify the current location coordinates of bicycles and display them on mobile phone applications, using 'cluster driving using BLE beacons'. For work efficiency, we decided to do it by dividing it into server development, positioning algorithm, and hardware development. While the project was going smoothly, the positioning algorithm part of a friend was blocked, and the entire development was stopped. There was a problem that the distance between the bicycles in the cluster was measured, but the direction was not known. I stopped the part I was developing for a while and gathered my team members to solve this problem. I came up with an idea how to measure the angle of view using the vectors I learned in high school mathematics, and then implemented an algorithm to measure the angle of view by promoting the method with my friends. And I was able to complete the project by finally figuring out the direction of the cluster. I don't think there's anything I can do well on my own. I think that when we work together to form a team called 'we', our true individual abilities are also demonstrated. ""The ability to communicate"" If you can't communicate and empathize with the customers, I don't think you provided real service. I once went to eat out with my family at a famous restaurant. Perhaps because it was lunchtime on the weekend, there were a lot of people. I called an employee and ordered, but they were served with a clichéd order. The food at the restaurant was delicious, but it wasn't a satisfactory meal. On the other hand, I remember being happily greeted by the owner when I went to another restaurant with a friend. When I ordered, I was much more comfortable choosing the food because they explained the spicyity, the well-selling menu, and the taste of the food in advance, and I felt that I received the service well, so I remembered it as a satisfactory meal. If the customer's point of view does not sympathize properly, we cannot know the true service that the customers want. I will always try to actively accept the inconvenience from the customer's point of view and improve it so that I can get satisfaction. I want to contribute to the improvement of KB customer satisfaction by developing customized IT services for KB Kookmin Bank's customers."
"[Smart Home Built with IOT] I took a subject called Creative Basic Engineering Design during my undergraduate class. I made a presentation with the topic of research on future industries and was new to IOT. As a result of the research, I found that it is a great promising technology in the future, and large foreign companies such as MS and SISCO are already investing a lot in IOT. As I got to know about IOT, I became more and more interested and dreamed of building a smart home developed with IOT technology. LG Electronics developed a function to control IOT home appliances by using smart TVs applied with WebOS 3.0, and I think that they have the same goal of building a smart home. I applied because I wanted to achieve my dream of building a smart home by using LG Electronics' webOS technology. [Problem solving through the transition of ideas] In order to develop the IOT development ability, I thought project experience was important, so I challenged several contests and projects. As the most memorable project, I did a project called 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycle Cluster' at an embedded lab in the school. It was a project to measure the distance between bicycles with mobile phone GPS and maintain them autonomously through Arduino signals when driving in groups of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while developing Arduino as he was in charge of the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. Various attempts were made to solve the problem, and the project could be completed using the change of idea of a direct connection between the electric bicycle circuit diagram and Arduino. Through this experience, I realized that a change of idea was necessary to solve the problem, and I also learned that IOT knowledge was lacking while trying various attempts. To compensate for this, I am studying by reading an IOT major book and am about to take the IOT Knowledge Competency Test certificate. [LG Electronics as the center of the world's IOT] We will try to integrate and optimize the webOS 3.0 IOT service controlled by smart TVs. First of all, I will try to understand the technology of the smart home appliance system powered by webOS 3.0, the linked smart ThinkQ hub, and the sensor. Furthermore, we will work on a joint project with the MC division to link mobile phones and webOS. As a result, we will proceed with an application development project that can simply control and manage IOT home appliances in the home through webOS with a mobile phone. And as IOT technology develops, we will steadily supplement webOS security technology in preparation for the complementary problems that become more important. In the long run, we will try to make LG smart home service available to many people around the world so that LG Electronics can stand tall as the center of the world's IOT."
"I've never taken a subject whose main goal is SW test (hereinafter referred to as test), but I've experienced the test process while debugging a project. I took [Computer Software Design] in the third grade and [CapSTONE DESIGN I/II] in the fourth grade, and what these three have in common is that they have to select one SW they made and release the results by the end of the semester. Among them, the project I was interested in is the creation of an adventure game I did at the end of the fourth grade, and I made it in a Windows environment using Java. The content is to move to the destination avoiding enemies or traps, but since I was involved in programming myself, I couldn't help but pay attention to the operation results and bugs. At the beginning of the project, I decided what to make, then I set a detailed process and a rough time for each process, and then I started making a skeleton by drawing an operation principle (algebra). When the algorithm was completed, I coded it in Java accordingly, and executed it every time, and if there was anything wrong, I debugged it and fixed it, and then I made the final result. Then, I conducted a final test and found and corrected it if there was anything wrong. Since the debugging process itself is a time-consuming and patient task, there were times when I struggled, and even if I looked for it, I was sometimes lost in thinking about how to fix it. There were times when I tried to solve the problem with the help of my team members, but most of them proceeded by referring to the Internet or booklets. As a result, I was satisfied with obtaining A in most projects, but through a series of processes, I realized anew how important the debugging and further testing process is. Due to the influence of this subject, I have decided to apply for the job category. The QAs I know are as follows. QA is an important process in any aspect. From the company's point of view, it is the final gateway to launching a great product, so it is necessary to carefully examine and review the product from the user's point of view. Of course, it requires a lot of concentration to uncover the problem, and a logical explanation is also required to communicate and persuade the developer and the management. For this explanation, a lot of knowledge about the project is required. As mentioned in question 1, there were times when I had a hard time because debugging (which can be called part of the test process) was a work that required time and patience, and even if I looked for it, I sometimes had a hard time thinking about how to fix it. There were times when I got help from my team members, but most of them looked for answers by looking at the Internet or booklets, but I had a desire to [solve what I was assigned with my own ability], so I solved most of them by myself. And I couldn't help but be delighted in the pride I felt when I found and corrected errors over and over again. Since then, I have been more interested in the process of 'decomposing', 'fixing', and 'looking into' rather than 'making'. As I have heard the case, [The proper program did not come out because I did not get the QA properly], I realized the importance of QA and came up with the idea that 'I can do better than myself', so I applied for a test job. I am systematic. I took classes in school and recorded what I always learned in a notebook, and organized them systematically to make it easy to read again. In addition, no matter what report I write, I can write carefully to make it easier for the reader to read, but on the other hand, to make it clear what I want to say. In order to write this, I think of the content to be said, then divide it into introduction, main body, and conclusion, write a rough draft, and then go through several discharge processes to derive the result. I have a sensitivity. I have the experience of making cover art as a hobby for three years in college. At first, I was interested in design itself, so I made it for fun, but as time passed, I was able to express art in my own way, and in fact, I was able to gain recognition by receiving orders from other musicians. Although I have given up on employment activities for a while, my interest in design has not yet disappeared, so I am always willing to do it again if I have a good idea. I listen before words. Although I am not good at communicating with the other person, I have supplemented my weaknesses by quietly listening to and acknowledging them. Of course, one's argument is important, and moreover, the ability of the test job group to persuade people is necessary. I also do not stop there, and I am constantly striving by practicing my speech every day. This effort will continue even after joining the company, and I will not stop to move toward better talent."
"""Finding a way to become a SW developer through games"" I was into games when I was in high school. I played several games, including Star, FIFA, and Sudden, and was one of the top five games on campus. That's how I enjoyed playing games, so I entered the Department of Computer Engineering. After entering the Department of Computer Engineering, I was attracted to programming while taking seminars and classes. As a program developer, it was rewarding that the code I made could help users, so I decided to make it a job. In particular, I thought that the development of individual programs for various customer segments, such as PCs and mobiles, would be diversified, and accordingly, I developed my practical skills through internship and club competitions to gain expertise in program development. I learned data structure, operating system, JAVA, etc. in my undergraduate course ""solid from the foundation"" and built the foundation through algorithmic study. In addition, as an assistant professor in the 2nd and 3rd grades, I have experience in setting and managing the development environment on more than 200 computers every semester. Based on this, I gained practical experience as a mobile developer at a development company in Seocho, Seoul for six months. In addition, I was able to develop my planning, development, and collaboration skills through government tasks and competitions. I took the position of leader while working on the project ""I put cooperation with my team first."" As a leader, I put a lot of effort into harmony and synergy with my team members. When faced with technical problems, I made time to think and share the solution process every week. As a result, I realized that praise is about dancing the whale, and as a result, I received the Excellence Award at the end of the year awards and exhibitions. Even after the project was over, I was able to meet them regularly and become an indispensable colleague in college life. I worked on the project with a sense of mission to create user-friendly programs while participating as the general manager in the government task of ""user-centered development capability."" I tried to create services by reflecting customer requirements in the entire process from planning to design and development. As a result, it was an unforgettable experience to see the customer through the results. ""I take responsibility for the tasks I have been assigned to."" When I first set up a team for my graduation work, I was embarrassed because there was no server developer. I took the position of server developer with the responsibility of leading the team as a team leader. After months of wrestling with Googling and Linux books, I built servers with Linux_Apache-MySQL-PHP (LAMP) stacks and developed the Rest API to communicate with my mobile. Through my best efforts, I received favorable reviews and excellence awards at the exhibition. This experience has made me realize that doing my best in my duties is rewarding."
"I participated in the Energy Hackathon because I wanted to help many people, as the meaning of my name ""Challenge to the World"" means to be used in a big way. I created a FinTech App that provides a convenient function with the ARS function and allows me to know the power I used at home right away. As a result, I got the grand prize and found that my ideas and produced programs can be helpful in many fields. Now, the era of using IT technology not only in fintech but also in every part of our daily lives has begun. In response, Lotte Information and Communication held a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of its foundation last year and declared a new vision to shift from IT service-oriented to business designers for sustainable growth. I think we need talented people who can challenge new visions and those who can work patiently in their duties. In that sense, I think it is suitable for the talent of Lotte Information and Communication. After joining the company, I will provide people with reliable and excellent technology for IT services and challenge emerging markets to the world. I have learned that changing ideas is important during the growth process of ""Energy Hackathon, Change of Ideas."" It was to create a fintech APP that could plan electricity use by allowing you to check the electricity usage at home in advance through energy hackathon with a smartphone. However, since a lot of fintech technologies have already been released, people around me gave negative opinions. So we thought differently and thought about whether it was convenient to use the technology from a user perspective, even though it was already made. Young people usually use smart devices well, but my grandmother and grandfather came up with something that was still difficult and uncomfortable for the blind. So, for the elderly and the visually impaired who do not use electronic devices well, we decided to add an ARS function to implement a function that can inform them of the amount they used by voice according to the current power usage. I made the Android part and had the team members make it using each API. We divided the roles and proceeded according to the limited time. As a result, more than half of smartphone users in their 30s and 60s were evaluated as being able to easily understand how much they consume in terms of money through the service, prevent indiscriminate power consumption, and prevent loss of money to individual households, and were awarded the Energy Hackathon. So, I learned that the results of my development by thinking about the customers' minds can be more efficient. In the future, I will continue to work on projects from various perspectives even after joining Lotte Information and Communication to make programs without any inconvenience. ""50, the spirit of challenge for success"" When I was in middle school, I challenged myself to learn how to ski with my friends through winter vacation. When I first dressed up and rode a lift, my eyes were just pitch black. However, as the hours and two hours went by, my skills gradually improved. Eventually, I felt like to challenge myself to a higher level course. I had fun learning and wanted to challenge myself to do it with a higher goal. However, the higher level course was not that easy. What I got was bruises and wet skiwear as I rolled down. Although I got an injury, I never gave up on going down the higher level course. After becoming a university student, I recklessly worked part-time at a ski resort shop for three months, which even a physical education student is reluctant to encounter more often. While living in a foreign country, I forgot the inconvenience in order to achieve my goal myself. During the three-month camp, I learned directly from the boss who knows skiing best, and built up basic knowledge by maintaining and managing ski equipment. As a result, a week before I finished my part-time job, when I went skiing, I challenged an advanced course and crossed the wall of the slope with an average slope of 50. Through this, I learned the importance of passion for my goal and was able to show that I was not afraid of failure. Even after joining Lotte Information and Communication, I will continue to work toward my goal without being afraid of failure. ""Challenging spirit and collaboration"" I think my strength is the spirit of challenge, and my weakness is the experience of collaboration with other fields. I learned it while preparing for a contest with my friend in college. Through the contest, I tried to make it convenient for those who use the guitar by recognizing the guitar score through video processing so that it can be easily stored and modified. To this end, I worked hard on planning and producing after school for three months with my friend. However, despite our efforts, we didn't get an award in the end. The reason is that we tried to complete it only with coding, but the image was not pretty. And I found that completing a program requires cooperation from people in various fields, not people in the SW field. Through this, I learned that my disadvantage is that I didn't have much experience in collaboration with people in other fields. A project needs the help of people in other fields, no matter how good they are. I didn't give up the challenge and found someone to help me create an image, and I finished the work by collaborating with people in other fields. As a result, I won the Samsung SW Development Competition. So what I felt was that the most important thing in a project was people. In the past, I thought it was fun to program alone. But I think it's hard to make a big project by myself. I think that working with people around me toward the same goal can make more fun and bigger results. In the future, Lotte Information and Communication will collaborate with people in other fields to overcome their shortcomings and challenge the goal of being the best. ""Global Talent"" In 10 years, the pace of IT transformation will accelerate. There must be IT professionals who can quickly acquire the latest technologies in that environment, reform groups in a more efficient direction, and respond quickly in the event of a crisis to prevent disruptions. So, when a difficult problem arises, I will become a talented person so that the name that comes to mind the most as a troubleshooter becomes my name.If I go to several conferences to become an IT expert, I will understand the current IT technology trends. And I will write the knowledge I studied every week using YouTube and blogs to remove the mind of being lazy by myself and make it a driving force to constantly run toward my goals even if I don't have a school or academy. So, I will apply amazing technologies in the IT field in many places in Lotte Information and Communication and change the color of society through IT system design and management. This is because my goal is to become a proud Lotte person who gives convenience to customers by maximizing the way I always stand in front of them and lead them."
"[Talent prepared for IoT] I entered graduate school and am conducting various research such as IoT-based smart home, analysis of sensor networks and big data, and mash-up service with situation recognition technology. It is a great joy and challenge for me to major in computer engineering that the field I am researching is the latest technology used as an actual commercial service and that it will be studied more actively in the future. In addition, I tried to gain competitiveness in my major field by developing Android apps, acquiring qualifications such as Oracle OCJP, and Cisco CCNA when I was an undergraduate. Steady efforts were able to produce high-quality results, including 3 international papers, 9 domestic papers, and 4 patent applications. It's been a long time since the term IoT was coined, but I think it has great research value as a core technology for the future industry and the problems to be solved. I want to develop with Hyundai Autoever and show my full capabilities through the learning and efforts so far. [Growth through Failure] When I took a class called Embedded Software, it was very difficult to follow from the first class and I felt very burdened with personal projects. I learned that it was a CPU governor with the advice of a senior in my lab at the time, and several tuning coverers were being provided and studied in overseas open communities to improve the strengths and weaknesses of each governor. It wasn't easy for me because I had never modified the kernel, but as it was my first project, I stayed up all night studying it. At first, I wanted to create a new coverner, but it wasn't easy, and I proceeded with the project by modifying and improving the existing open governor. Every moment was a new challenge when I was performing performance evaluations with porting a governor to an Android phone and various benchmark programs. Although I failed to develop an improved governor, I am still working on graduate research thinking about the passion of the time, such as getting to know the governor through the project and potting to an Android phone. I aim to live a planned life as much as possible. In the new year, I write plans for this year and make weekly plans at the beginning of each month. Second, I have stronger physical strength than others. I maintain my physical strength through constant exercise, and finally, I have a strong mental strength through a positive mind. This strength of me is that I will carry out my tasks with a planned and positive mind and strong physical strength in performing the tasks given after joining the company. The downside is that people around me worry a lot in advance. Perhaps it's because of the promise with me to keep the plans I've made in advance. Second, multitasking is difficult. So, when a task is given at the same time, I have to finish one task to proceed with the next task. This weakness of me is that I will try to perform tasks more planned by subdividing and step-by-step after joining the company."
"For the development of game server, I studied my major focusing on network and database. For smooth network and database programming, I took C programming, Linux system, network and data communication, and database based on my major. Based on these basic subjects, I programmed banking management in database programming, which is an application subject. In DBMS utilization and practice, we built a shopping mall using database and web programming. In addition, in Linux system programming, I learned how to manage servers using C language in the CentOS environment. The subject I was most interested in was network programming. The reason for this is that for the first time, I created an e-mail server and client called SMTP while watching an Internet English document called RFC, and there were many difficulties because I had to connect closely between the server and the client moving in the backbone only with C code rather than the application programming directly on the screen, which I have done before, so I was able to upgrade my programming skills. Based on this server development ability, I will develop a smooth game server for Netmarble's games and users. I am a Netmarble-type talent who develops good games and cooperates with my team members. When I was a freshman in college, I first encountered the world of computer software while taking C programming. I was curious to see how it appeared on the monitor using basic control statements and repetitive statements, such as obtaining a triangle area using C language and making a diamond shape. I belonged to the Internet Security Research Institute, so I started a data structure seminar using C language in the first year of college, and I enjoyed programming itself. The programming competition was perfect to maximize this fun. In order to pass the preliminary round as a team of three people, I started downloading and solving existing problems from Google. I fell in love with programming enough fun to think about the difficulty I felt for the first time and the number of colorful cases for programming, and to print and carry programming problems every class. It was a good opportunity to acquire English skills when solving additional English problems. I failed to pass the preliminary round, but I had a lot of fun using programming as an opportunity, and I am still using algorithms. The most important thing in my job, game development, is to understand the appropriate demands and development skills for customized game development. In the second semester of graduate school, we developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. In order to collaborate with the Automotive Parts Research Institute, which was the main target of the application, and the laboratory that uses real vehicles at other universities, we started the development by comparing dozens of parameters and requirements. Since the main purpose of the application was an application for safety service, I studied the safety service currently being studied in advance, and studied additional proposed or modified parameters in academic societies and papers, and continued to study what is the most important point of safety service, and what companies are in the main target audience. Based on this, I used Java programming to show on the screen the location coordinates of own and other vehicles, which were values received from the network simulator, and at the same time, made additional improvements so that the vehicle's location could be seen moving together according to the moving coordinate values. ""Undergraduate project experience"" 1. 1st grade - role (individual development), responsible (C language: triangle, rock-paper-scissors, diamond, etc.) - role (follower), responsible (college student programming competition) 2. 2nd grade - role (two-person team leader), responsible (java: book management application development) 3. 3rd grade - role (four-person team leader), responsible (JDBC bank management system UML work and development general management) - role (three-person team leader), responsible (MFC poop avoidance development, Windows programming study operation, project presentation PPT writing) - role (four-person team follower), responsible (Linux system programming-CentOS utilization basic Linux utilization) - role (four-person team follower), responsible (network programming-ubutility, SMTP development using C language, modification of source code for client function, presentation PPT general) 4. 4th grade - role (four-person team follower), responsible (Android calendar memo app development, app user information management function, and overall UI function development) - role (individual development), responsible (OS Roundrobin algorithm implementation) - role (four-person team leader), responsible (four-person team leader), responsible (graduation thesis: grafting OTP onto FTP (java development - utilization of open source), OTP related trend survey and app development, FTP application implementation) - role (three-person team leader), responsible (college student programming competition)"
"""Good Dexterity Bad Boy"" I've always loved making things since I was a child. My grandmother used to hold my hand and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school every day, but when I matched it, I focused on making it to the point where the day went by. Before I knew it, I had a screwdriver and a solder in my hand. It has become a hobby to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that the ability to concentrate and analyze from an early age is the result of finding errors in the source code or being able to sit in one place for a long time. It will help the project progress by finding errors that others cannot see and reducing the time to analyze and understand algorithms. I think that if you don't do what you're given, you'll be harmed or you'll become lazy. So my job is to try to do it to the end. When I get stuck in the middle of the work, I try to find another way to solve the problem and try not to hurt others. This has become a strength for me, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""The consistency of water droplets can penetrate rocks."" When I was a child, my father told me to do my job on my own. He said that if I do what is given to me, I will harm others or I will become lazy. So, I have a personality that tries to do my job until the end. When I get stuck in the middle of work, I try to find a different way to solve problems and not to hurt others. This has become my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""If you give up, you can't dream."" When I first lived in college, I felt ashamed of myself for falling behind students who had learned in IT from high school, and after I was discharged from the military, I had a lot of fear of returning to school. However, I couldn't give up my interest in IT, so I decided to return to school, and I focused on studying so that I wouldn't fall behind other students. When I was in second grade, I created a delivery food app in the school area, and dreamed about my job as a software developer. It was a meaningful time to learn about harmony among the team members and the preparation process of the project while making a gym management program with them in the third grade. In the fourth grade, I received an overall education on Java through a security developer course based on a core structure that can be used directly from the practice implemented by the Hanbit Education Center to acquire insufficient programming knowledge, which gave me an opportunity to grow to the next level. When I first created the delivery app as a team project ""the result of interest and pride,"" it was interesting to see that students were interested. The higher the interest, the more I became attached and proud, and I decided to become a software developer. That's why I practiced by reading, coding, and coding software-related books in the library every day. With this consistency, I want to fill in the gaps and pursue a developer's path. In the book titled ""The Law of 10,000 Hours,"" he said that if you work hard for a total of 10 years for 3 hours a day, you become an expert in a field. I want to be recognized as an expert and become a developer who is helpful to someone."
"[Life of Communication] I have grown through communication since I was in elementary school. When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, I was the president and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. My teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class. Based on this, I was able to further improve my communication skills while serving as the president in the fifth and sixth grades. I worked in a tennis club in college. As the 'leadership manager' who plans training, I discussed training methods with my club members through weekly meetings. Through this, I was able to increase my teamwork and achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a national competition involving 128 university teams. Through this experience, I believe that the definition of communication is 'achievement'. It is because good results have always followed good communication. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. After joining the company, I will show good results through internal communication with my customers and colleagues. [Dreaming Developer] I made the following efforts to become a developer in the IT field. First, I took courses in C, C++, Java, Android, Python, and Verilog. Through this, I was able to learn various languages and learn the differences between languages. Second, I learned the basics and skills of programming through the subject of data structure and algorithms. Through this, I was able to learn how to design with an emphasis on optimization and efficiency. Third, I was able to learn about Linux systems through system programming, operating system, and embedded computing. I worked on a project based on these Linux systems. I controlled the Linux kernel and device driver through 'unmanned parking' using Raspberry Pi, 'smart home for working mothers', and a project using a real router. Finally, I worked as an intern in the graduate lab for a year. Through various Linux systems and LVS, I was able to experience the overall network using Linux systems. The criteria for selecting a [customer-oriented pioneer] company is to prioritize whether it matches the company's direction. The Hyundai Department Store Group is aiming at 'the company most trusted by customers'. As a developer, my value is 'to make convenient products'. I think these points are consistent with each other in terms of 'customer orientation'. I applied because I wanted to make products for customers based on synergy. In 2015, I proceeded with the project by using EV3 car robots. Since I use car robots, I started looking for topics that can provide convenience to drivers. He is always good at driving, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of his house, so I selected the theme as ""unmanned parking."" First, parking lines were detected through video processing using a camera. It is composed of a system that automatically parks by controlling the wheel motor according to the location of the detected line. I think this experience will help Hyundai Green Food make products for customers. [Please Take Care of My Working Mom] I think that the advantage that differentiates me from others is 'executive power'. After joining the company, I will take the initiative in my work based on my execution power. In 2013, I had a part-time job at a middle school entrance examination institute. The phone calls to the academy were mainly from working mothers asking if the student arrived at the academy safely. Through this, we came up with an idea from areas concerned about the safety of the students and produced the 'Smart Home for Working Mom' project. First, we made smart home devices such as Gab Valve and Interphone. We created a smartphone app so that the mother at work can control these smart home devices. Based on this, we have constructed a system that can keep the safety of a child alone at home. Based on this experience, Hyundai Green Food will first identify the needs of customers. Based on our execution ability, we will meet our customers' needs and solve their problems. Through this, we will make our customers happy and take the lead in achieving Vision 2020."
"[Life of Communication] I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. When I was the 4th grade, I was the chairman and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to lead a good atmosphere in the class. In addition, I further improved my communication skills by serving as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades. I participated in the 2015 contest and showed my communication skills. The team members had difficulty choosing a topic because they were interested in different fields due to different majors. To solve the difficulties, I listened to the team members. Rather than deciding alone as a leader, I could come up with more ideas while listening to the team members' opinions. Through this process, I was able to decide on the topic of 'HVDC'. Several majors came together to approach the topic from various perspectives, prepare a practical and objective story, and passed the document screening process through the competition ratio of 22:1. I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. I made good results because of the good free speech and listening among the team members. After joining the company, I will show good results through stories from colleagues, related technology companies, and customers. I had the experience of solving the concerns of working mothers and leading up to the award. I applied in line with KCC's direction of putting customers first. When I worked part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to see if the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and it was an opportunity to develop a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that could keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. First, we organized various smart home devices. We created a smartphone app to control these smart home devices with a smartphone. Implementing the function optimized for working mothers, I won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the Presidential Award at the School Graduation Work Competition. KCC has recently been pursuing to improve customer service through preparing a mobile network environment and VR showrooms. In addition, it also meets the needs of customers through smart glass and smart flooring. I think the experience of solving working mothers' concerns is consistent with KCC's customer orientation. After joining the company, we will make all KCC products smart and give customers convenience. I think the role of the computerized job is to solve the inconvenience of users in the computer system. I have experience in developing an 'unmanned parking' system to solve the inconvenience of novice drivers. In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using an EV3 car robot. He is always good at driving, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in the parking lot, so I chose 'unmanned parking'. First, I detected the parking line using a camera. Based on the location and number of detected parking lines, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. In addition, we added a convenient function. I installed LEDs next to wheels because I had difficulty parking when parking at dark night because I couldn't see wheels. We created a convenient parking environment by implementing the LEDs to turn on automatically in dark situations. I got A+ credit and user-oriented importance from the professor's high praise for placing importance on user convenience. I think the main customer of KCC computer system is the 'employee'. After joining the company, I will become a new employee who listens to the inconvenience of the employees and improves them. I think I am suitable for those who are honest with their customers and organizations, and have a sense of duty and responsibility. I have experience in making good results by faithfully serving as a coach. During the years when I was working in a tennis club, I did not have good results in national competitions. As a coach planning training, I thought that the reason why I did not have good results was a problem with the training method. I had a weekly meeting with my team members to set my goal of making it to the finals, and through the feedback, I changed my training method as follows. First, it was 'practical experience.' Some of the team members were freshmen who had never played actual games. Therefore, they played actual games with various opponents as part of the training. By inspiring interest in tennis, I developed a sense of practice. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' We conducted the survey by asking each team member about their shortcomings one by one. Unlike the past when all the team members used the same training method, the training method was divided by level to fill in the gaps. As a result, my skills improved by supplementing my shortcomings, and advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 teams."
"[3 driving forces] I had a very eventful growth process due to my family background, which was three sisters when I was young and four siblings when I was young, and my father's special job. I had a lot of family members, so if I didn't do what was given to me, it was a mess. It was a complicated process where I often acted as I wanted because it was difficult for my parents to focus on one person. It influenced a lot in the formation of my personality. It developed a sense of responsibility for a given task, drive for what I wanted to do, and leadership as a leader. During my school life, I was in charge of the most group projects, and I was able to finish all the projects first, especially by playing a leading role in the deepening coding classes in the C++ programming class. In addition, I have developed into a professional level after numerous failures and successes in order to solve the big homework of presentation that I had given to me when I entered college. When I was in the role of accounting in the club, I participated in all meetings and events sincerely, and I have a habit of checking carefully to avoid any problems, especially in the financial aspects necessary to successfully carry out the event. Responsibility, drive, and leadership are the driving forces that I try to do my best in any organization I belong to. When I join IDIS, I will work hard as a driving force based on these three principles in the organization that is given to me. [2D] My tenet is 2D. 2D is Dedicate and Develop, which means to develop by yourself no matter which organization you belong to and in any environment you are in. Since I was young, I have devoted myself to reading books or attending computer classes after school in order to develop various abilities, and I have always served with the mindset of serving in both classes and clubs. In situations of need, I have always provided what I have when I need it. I have helped in a variety of ways, from small to big, and as a result, I have been nicknamed ""out of the blue."" It means that I fill in what I really need when I need it. When a need arises in IDIS, I will come forward according to the tenets and become the employee who fills in the need. [21st Century Candy] I grew up the third of four siblings in a not very wealthy family environment. There were many trees on the tree that had no good wind days, so we did, and this is why I have a candy-like personality that swallows my negative emotions and gives off positive energy. In a university that requires group activities, such as an undergraduate or club, my positive and bright personality has been able to win favor from people and resolve conflicts, big and small, without difficulty. This will have a positive effect on the organization as well as an employee who can lead a bright atmosphere. However, sometimes the positive can be poisonous. When I was young, I didn't study during exams, saying that I could study later, and when I was just entering college, I put off doing what I had to do. However, recognizing that these habits were wrong, I tried to do what I had to do in order to correct them without putting off writing down on my smartphone wallpaper or purchasing a small scheduler. As a result, I have no delay in what I have to do, and I have been able to sort out big and small things, organize them well and handle them efficiently. Candy sometimes shows a bad attitude toward delaying what I have to do. However, I am always determined and striving to open the scheduler. [Design-aware developer] Development and design are very different, so there are many cases where they don't understand their areas. However, as a design-aware developer, I can act as a bridge to consider design from the development stage. If it takes 100 hours to become a great software program and a great design program at the same time, I can shorten the time by 30 hours in my role. When I was working on a team project based on language C Tetris in the algorithm class, I was able to develop a design program unlike other teams. I didn't have enough time because I tried to add design elements to the programs that were already made, except for a few teams, and I couldn't take this into account, but my team was able to successfully complete the project on time because we created a program that considered design from the beginning. The project results were well received and are currently being used as teaching materials. As a developer who knows how to eliminate the possible discord and develop software more efficiently, I would like to create an integrated security solution at IDIS. [mission and vision, together] The first thing I learned in the second half of 2016 was mission and vision in the class called 'Startup and Technology Management'. I was taught that mission is the ultimate value and reason for existence of a company, and vision is a short-term goal for misson. In addition, I was taught that a company with mission and vision does not collapse easily and can succeed in every way, which is why I applied for IDIS. IDIS' mission is 'contributing to making a safer and happier world through creation and innovation'. With my creed of 2D, I want to contribute to making a happy world by demonstrating my role as a floating gold medalist at IDIS. My future ambition is to continue working for a company for a long time and grow with that company. As a member of the club I served as an accountant, I worked hard in everything, believing that even if what I did in the club was nothing more than a small flap, it would be like a big storm in the future. Having spent four years in a club together, I learned that it is better to change where I belong than to find a place that suits my taste.Even if the results are insignificant, my goal is to do my best where I belong and be with you. If I join IDIS, I want to work to become a company that provides the best solutions in the world, which is IDIS's current vision, and to further achieve my mission. My special strength is communication and solid basic skills. In the first semester of my fourth year, I developed Bookbeol, an application for lending and selling books, as a graduation project. I organized the home screen with Tab, which I used to use comfortably, but I suffered from errors due to the difficulty of Tab, which had slightly different composition depending on the compatibility of the textbook and Android Studio version and its use. In fact, since it was a graduation project, the fact that it was carried out rather than implementation was enough, but our team worked hard together to solve the problem through discussions, and eventually changed to Button, not Tab, and developed it. As a team member, I was able to develop my communication skills, as I helped the team leader and took the role of a clerk to facilitate the progress of the team project. The most important thing in my major is the solid foundation. Practical experience and experience are important, but I thought I needed to lay the foundation well because I needed to actually start working on what kind of tasks I would perform, and I prepared a lot. First of all, I took classes in subjects such as C, JAVA, C++, and algorithm with a sincere attitude, and as a result, I was able to achieve good grades. In addition, I participated in the C language competition and JAVA competition held on campus, and received an encouragement award at the C language competition. I also studied the information processing technician certificate, which is considered essential in my related major, and have passed the written test, and am currently conducting a practical test, and I am expected to pass the result of additional grading. I have put a lot of effort into such a solid foundation, which will be the cornerstone for me to learn a sincere attitude and work well even after joining IDIS."
"""Life of Communication"" Since elementary school, I have grown by communicating. When I was in the fourth grade of elementary school, I was the president and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. My teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class. Based on this, I was able to further improve my communication skills while serving as the president in the fifth and sixth grades. I worked in a tennis club in college. As the 'leadership manager' who plans training, I discussed training methods with my club members through weekly meetings. Through this, my teamwork was able to increase, and I was able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a national competition involving 128 university teams. Through this experience, I believe that the definition of communication is 'achievement'. It is because good results have always followed good communication. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. I think this communication ability is useful when I work in cooperation with other departments and team members. I think it will be helpful to communicate smoothly and exchange opinions efficiently. I felt the importance of readability after reading the books, ""Readability through 'Because it hurts' to be youth'"" and ""It hurts to be youth."" Among the books I read recently, the most memorable one is 'It's because I'm in pain. I don't have a habit of reading books, so it takes me a long time to understand if it contains even a little difficult content. However, Nan-do Kim easily solved the story, so it was easy to understand because it was good to read. Based on this experience, I thought readability was important for program developers. I learned the lesson that I have to implement the code readably because the code is shared by many people, not alone. The advantage of being a "" meticulous tree that gives without hesitation"" personality is that it takes care of others. I like to remember conversations with others in detail and give them anniversaries, favorite foods, etc. because I have a good memory. It is because I feel good when I see the other person's favorite appearance. In this way, my nickname has become ""the tree that gives freely"" among seniors, juniors, and colleagues. Through this, I will listen to the opinions of customers through communication with customers in the future. I will become a generous tree that creates and provides the services that customers want based on listening. The disadvantage of my personality is that I am meticulous and slow in processing things. When I work normally, I tend to be unsatisfied if I don't do it perfectly. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I prioritize my work and proceed with what I can do quickly. Now that I'm very familiar with it, I'm taking turns doing my work by prioritizing it according to the deadline. I think that these shortcomings will be delayed when developing them according to a tight schedule. After joining the company, I will save the strengths, compensate for the shortcomings, and demonstrate my abilities. ""Please Take Care of a Working Mom"" As I was interested in IoT, I conducted ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" as a graduation work. I think it can be used in Timon as a result of my interest in execution and technology. In 2013, I had a part-time job at a middle school entrance examination institute for six months. The calls to the academy were mainly from mothers who worked asking if the student arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I got an idea from the part concerned about the safety of the students and planned a ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" project. We produced ""Smart Home for Working Mom"" with the following system. First, we have constructed smart home devices for the safety of children. We have configured 'gas valve' using a servo motor, 'interphone' using a switch sensor, and 'air conditioner' control that shows temperature using an LCD. We also created 'Please Take Care of a Working Mom' smartphone application so that a mother at work can control these smart home devices with a smartphone. Based on this, we were able to implement a system that could keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. Second, we have configured it to do housework. This is because working mothers are interested in not only the safety of their children but also housework. To this end, we have configured smart home devices that check the inside of a refrigerator using a magnetic sensor, feed pets using a servo motor, and control fluorescent lights in the house based on LEDs. We have implemented a system that allows people to blend housework together. Smartphones and smart home devices are linked together so that they can be controlled with a smartphone. Based on this, we were able to highlight the role of working mothers who can pay attention to housework together. Third, we added robots in the house. It has been configured to control the robot with a smartphone when there is a place to check everywhere in the house. In addition, by attaching a beacon to the robot, a differentiating element has been added so that the current location can be identified on the smartphone. Based on the execution power, it has been implemented focusing on convenience and safety according to the needs of customers. Based on this experience, I think it will be helpful in various fields such as creating applications, building web servers, and implementing services that customers need. Through this, after joining the company, we will first identify the needs of customers at Tmon. Based on execution power, we will meet the needs of customers and solve customers' problems. Through this, we will become new employees who take the lead in performing tasks by adding differentiating factors. I think the moment when we set and achieved the goal of ""developing an unmanned parking system using EV3"" was the most meaningful. After joining the company, I will overcome difficulties through problem solving skills. In 2015, I carried out a project using Raspberry Pi and EV3 automobile robots. The value as a developer is 'to make convenient products'. He drives well, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of his house, so I chose the theme as 'unmanned parking'. Based on this, we set the goal to link the 'unmanned parking' system by implementing the function of the actual car. I organized the project in the following way. During programming, I experienced the following challenges. First, attaching five cameras to give me a parking field of view was a choice that overlooked the performance of the hardware.""Life of Communication"" Since elementary school, I have grown by communicating.

"In my life, I am living with the motto of 'careful and like'. Being passionate about something and liking it is because I believe that not only developing insight into a field, but also a lot of experience I have in the process will help me develop myself. Therefore, I am living with the importance of being deeply engaged in whatever I do and making my own. This value has become the advantage of digging deeper into the field of interest than anyone else and bringing it out into competence. When a friend asked me to create a homepage in the past, I focused all day long, relearned the skills, completed it one by one, and succeeded in producing satisfactory results. In addition, knowing one field has developed the ability to know about other fields and think from more diverse perspectives, which has also been my strength. My weakness is that sometimes my level of enthusiasm is a little overheated, so I don't respond even if someone calls me, or I starve to death all day and do something in one thing. In order to overcome these shortcomings, I also flexibly set the schedule adjustment so that I do not get too immersed in it, so that I can distribute the weight of other tasks evenly. I want to spread Korean literature contents through digital methods and make people from all over the world interested in Korean literature. It was a pity that Korean cultural contents succeeded in enhancing the status of overseas, centering on K-POP, but there were relatively few cases where literary works such as poetry and novels were known. I believe that Korean literature will be more recognized in the world if it can be introduced in a wider variety of ways through video production or graphics. As I have been exposed to computers since I was young, I realized that the delivery of computer contents, especially through networks, will become important in the future society. The homepage, one of the means to exchange contents on the Internet, was created and released for the first time when I was in the fifth grade of elementary school. With this experience as an opportunity, I started to deal with graphic production tools such as Photoshop and Flash, and produced graphic images, banners, and simple animations. By the time I was a high school student, YouTube had appeared to deal with programs that produced and edited videos, believing that the way contents were delivered would change, centering on videos. This experience was a great help in producing product pages and banners when I became a college student while working part-time at an Internet shopping mall, and it was also a driving force in producing and releasing videos used for school events when I was affiliated with a university broadcasting station. My dream is to further develop the content culture in Korea so that everyone, including myself, can lead a better cultural life. In order to achieve that dream, I drew my way by thinking about the content market in five years, 10 years, and beyond. Five years later: Even though great contents have been produced, I cannot afford to distribute or promote them, so I contribute to promoting the contents to everyone by assisting in promotional activities. Ten years later: cultural contents such as Korean literature and cartoons are now widely known overseas. However, for long-term success overseas, more diverse genres of contents should be known and shown to many people. Based on my experience at the Korea Literature Translation Institute, I have produced and promoted videos that promote various works. Since then: In order to go further as a content powerhouse, it is necessary to continuously develop and discover content. I am planning a start-up that can help with content production, drawing up countless ideas that have not been expressed, and through this, I can produce more advanced content."
"First, a talented person who quickly adapts to the environment, grows and leads innovation. I have worked on various projects and have experienced various languages, platforms, development environments, methodologies, and productivity-related tools. So, I am not afraid to develop in a new environment. No matter what mission is assigned, I will become a talented person who quickly adapts and produces results. Second, a person who teaches me what I have learned again will be short-lived, but Korea's S/W industry will continue. After joining the company, I will pass on the learned knowledge to my juniors, so that Hankom will contribute to sustainable growth. Through the above two values, I will grow with the company and pass on what I have learned to the next generation, contribute to the continuous development of Korean language and computers, and further strengthen the competitiveness of Korea's S/W industry, and my ultimate dream is to become an S/W powerhouse. Rather than being satisfied with my assignments and good grades at school, I tried to become a 'real developer' through various project experiences. 1 Group-based schedule synchronization Android app (5 months) 2 700 people Intranet development and operation (13 months) 3 Interactive promotion site (4 months) 4 NOSQL web dashboard (3 months) 5 O2O website related to home sharing (6 months) 6 ACM ICPC algorithm competition (2013-2015, 3 years) I wanted to erase the feeling of a student from me until today, when I started developing it. I made the above efforts to acquire the mindset and skills of an expert. As a result, I was able to design programs from the user's point of view, take the initiative in projects, and become a talented person who can fulfill my role. Now, I really want to get away from being a student and become a developer of Hangul and computers. I have the following tenets. First, I tried to experience many fields. When I was a short undergraduate, I tried to become a person with strong background knowledge in the overall IT field by experiencing various fields rather than digging deep into one field. Second, I thought basic studies such as algorithms, design patterns, and networks were important. This is because I thought basic studies were factors that were directly connected to performance, such as memory issues. Finally, I wanted to become a developer who can collaborate with colleagues. I don't think there is a developer who can make a program alone. Therefore, I think the ability to communicate with team members and to proceed with projects systematically is just as important as development ability. Based on this, Hancom will fully demonstrate my abilities and contribute to the development of proud domestic offices."
"When I first learned about computers, I was interested in the relationship between S/W and the people who use them. Therefore, I mainly worked on projects that were close to people, such as an intranet that easily stores and helps members manage their information, promotional sites that entertain users' eyes with dynamic effects, and websites that support home sharing procedures. As a result, I realized that the people who use them in S/W development are really important. That's why I thought of Lotte. Lotte's mission is to contribute to the prosperous life of mankind by providing products and services that are loved and trusted. I thought that there must be a part that I can contribute as a developer to Lotte's efforts to contribute to the prosperous life of people in various fields. Lotte, the company closest to people, will grow up with the company with the dream of providing better services based on my S/W capabilities. 'To become a competent developer, not a good student!' I wanted to become a developer based on theories rather than a student who does assignments well and receives good grades in school. So I always thought about what I should do to achieve my desired goal, rather than passively taking classes and doing assignments. As a result, I ran toward my dream through two years of S/W specialized training, experience in various projects ranging from 3 to 4 months, and challenge for 3 consecutive years in the OO college programming competition. From the 2nd grade when I started development to the present day, I wanted to erase the feeling of a student from me, and I tried to have various experiences to acquire the mindset and skills of a professional. As a result, I was able to design programs from the user's point of view, take the initiative in participating in projects, and become a talented person who can fulfill my role. Now, I will truly escape from being a student and continue my growth at Lotte. The membership of the ""oo company S/W membership network division manager, who wanted to be of strength to the membership"" has three division managers, each of software, hardware, and network. Before members started their assignments, they gave technical advice on their field, participated in the opening and interim presentations with the membership manager to evaluate them, and also participated in interviews for new employees. Among them, I was selected as the head of the network division. I thought that I should be helpful to the organization called membership, so I studied the basics day and night and tried to become a branch manager that would be helpful to the members. On the day of the assignment meeting, I looked at the documents written by the members a day earlier and wondered if there was anything to study and give them any advice. And in order to ask logical and objective questions during the assignment evaluation or new interview, I prepared twice as much as the usual meeting. As a result, I gained the trust of the members as I was recognized as a sub-chairman who can share and think about solutions no matter what problems arise. It was the result of thinking that the members' assignments were my assignments, and they were interested in me, and helped me a lot. Although it was difficult for me, it was a great opportunity to naturally study various fields, which helped me a lot in the long run. When I passed on to the next sub-chairman after my term in office, there was a lot different from the beginning. I have developed knowledge, self-management skills, and above all, 34 strong motives in the IT field. Now, I want to fully show my capabilities in a new organization called Lotte. 'This is one of the two things I have been solving now that I have died!` When I was on the intranet team, I used to say this as a half-joking joke when my coworkers asked me if I wasn't going to bed. As such, I have the strength to do my best to solve an issue that arises during the project process. I came to have the above character because I enjoyed the series of processes of trying this or that various methods and eventually finding the cause of the problem and solving it. Rather than simply a one-dimensional solution to the problem, I tried to track and solve the issues that were slightly suspicious or open to improvement. I used to forget about sleeping until late at night and engage in problems one by one, analyzing sources line by line, or asking for help from references or communities. As a result, I was able to develop a broader and stronger foundation and ability to cope with exceptions. Those experiences have come together and have greatly influenced my belief that any problem can be solved with perseverance and effort. Even today, that idea remains unchanged, and I am confident that I will overcome any problem with my passion and perseverance. However, I couldn't afford to do other hobbies due to my immersion in the IT field. I liked extreme sports, but I often skipped thinking, 'I'm going to do it next time after doing everything I'm busy now.' So, these days, I'm not only developing it, but I'm trying to live a leisurely life with occasional hobbies. 'It provides new user experiences with more personalized services.' I will analyze customer information and Lotte's service usage history at Lotte and recommend services that customers may need to provide new user experiences. Today, with the development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, computers are gradually understanding people. Accordingly, in the past, if the service used by all customers was simply ranked and provided to users, now it is necessary to analyze the customer's service usage tendency and pattern and provide 'service only for that customer' accordingly. Therefore, I would like to do a job of analyzing and providing services suitable for users at Lotte based on my S/W technology. By providing Lotte's service to customers, we will contribute to becoming a more trusted Lotte by the people by providing differentiated user experience."
"[Challenging attitude that transcends limits] I don't think it's difficult to develop my potential skills anymore. It bothered me that I didn't achieve anything before joining the military. Meanwhile, I saw a competition for entrepreneurship on campus, and I decided to take on a new challenge and put it into action immediately. With my colleagues and I, we planned a device called a mobile application vending machine in consideration of the release of smartphones. The idea was to install devices that help transmit content using Bluetooth at stations and stations at the time, given that it was not easy to access content on public transportation due to the low penetration rate of smartphones. However, due to the end-of-semester exams in the middle of the semester, the spirit of the beginning disappeared, and I also wanted to give up and focus on other studies, but it was a waste of work that I had been doing so far, and it was a shame that I gave up in the middle. The members of the group agreed with this. Also, because I was the one who attracted everyone, I was able to motivate them again and apply in a short period of time by working late at school even after the exam. As a result, I was able to develop into a person who not only won statues and prize money, but also actively participated in new challenges since then. I want to become a person who leads by actively participating in new challenges such as building a promising IoT network at SK Telecom. [A future where actions that no one has done, not ideas, change] I even got a reward for solving the problem with constant analysis and extraordinary tenacity. When I was in the military, my cleaning area was in charge of a public bathhouse. It was an arduous area where cleaning was repeated every night and the sewage that flows backward was called every night. When I observed the public bathhouse all day to find out the cause of the continuous clogged sewer, it was the sand falling from the indoor shoes I wore when I took the bath. As a result, I advised the company members to come in barefoot when entering the public bathhouse, but few people obeyed the request. As another solution, I set up a sentry to point out during the bath time, but it was too inefficient, and I went back to the drawing board. When I was in trouble again, I analyzed the cause of wearing slippers and found that there was no clear boundary between the hallway and the bathhouse, so I was able to enter and exit without hesitation. So, when I used bricks to separate the shoe removal area at the entrance of the bathhouse, I naturally took off my slippers and went in, so I couldn't find grains of sand in the bathhouse. After that, the administrative supply officer saw this and ordered me to run errands like this, and as a reward, I even got a night out. I felt that if I analyzed it with grit rather than dissatisfaction when I encountered a problem, the result could be that things that no one had thought of could be discarded. [Depending on intelligence makes whales dance] Rather than ignoring it because it is different from me, I chose to make a small sacrifice. During the second grade curriculum, I was assigned to create a game that was easily manipulated using Microsoft Visual Studio in groups of two in a subject called ""Application Design"". I formed a group with a friend who was normally like-minded, and through a compromise, I planned a game to find points in a maze. However, when I started making the game, I started to get into trouble. While I had planned to create prototypes based on what I learned in class, I kept revising and adding them, but my friend ignored the process, saying it would be a waste of time to do so. However, I gradually started programming, and whenever I was finished one by one, I went to my friend and asked him for his results and opinions. He first pressed me, asking why I did that, but as the saying goes, if you have an intellect, you should be grateful. Perhaps if you tried to complete it by yourself or thought it was unfair to do it by yourself, you would not have achieved satisfactory results within the period. After that, the game was executed without difficulty on the day of the presentation, and I could see the satisfied professor's expression. Since then, I have felt that everyone gets satisfactory results if they sacrifice themselves, as well as blame others in conflict with the other person. [Realizing the beauty of engineering] The time I took to learn the beauty of engineering from my uncle, who was an engineering student, paved the way for me. I often worked part-time in my uncle's factory. I learned step by step from processing to assembling. One day, I was organizing electric wiring, and my uncle showed me how to organize the wiring, saying, 'Engineering is a job that pursues beauty'. He said that it is not only good to look neat, but it can also reduce working hours to solve problems in the future. Since then, I have been more touched by the messy wiring in other factories. I gained a lot from that experience. Due to the nature of my major, I had a lot of circuit experiments and programming practice. When I debugging the source I programmed during the practice, when a large amount of bugs occurred, my eyes were dark. Every time, I started to develop a habit of organizing things one by one, recalling my uncle's lessons. I spared no effort until the moment I saw it and felt neat and beautiful. Since then, no matter what kind of bug occurred, and no matter how much the circuit I configured did not work, I have achieved the result of seeing the neat structure and solving it in a short time. I came to think that not only artists but also engineers should pursue rational beauty. In the future, even when dealing with tasks given to me in my job, I think that if I deal with them based on those lessons, I can do things more efficiently than anyone else. [Embedded system education that is more valuable than scholarships] We have a chance to take a step closer to the IoT industry, which is impossible to beat in our lives in the future. I had an opportunity to learn the Embedded System using ATmega 128 through a subject called a third-grade microprocessor. At that time, I burned my enthusiasm for learning after seeing an article on the Internet that a foreign elementary school student made and sold multifunctional digital watches that he programmed. In fact, the theory class was boring.However, when I entered the program without understanding the exact theory, I could not neglect the theory class because I saw that the bug did not add up. In addition, after learning that Embedded System is an essential part of everyday devices in the future, I wanted to know more details and accurately than others. The contents of the class ranged from turning on the LED to making a digital watch that a little kid did. However, I was unfamiliar with the C language, and the professor seemed tired from the constant questions. However, I completed the watch with a clear belief, and as a result, I participated in the on-campus capstone design contest with the recommendation of the professor. While preparing for the PPT to present the project design process and results I did in the lecture, it was easy to understand the Embedded System, and the structural understanding of ATmega 128 became clearer. Luckily, I was able to get a scholarship through an on-campus contest"
"The first project undertaken by the ou software membership was 'Kimchinity', which can be simultaneously developed using a server, and a game development tool made of WPF is used to create and execute games on the web. It was the first project of my membership, and I was so happy to make my own Tzukur game that I only enjoyed, that I decided to complete it. However, due to the lack of preliminary research, there were many difficulties in implementing it, and since all the team members were in charge of developing the genre for the first time, there were problems in acquiring skills. The morale of the team members was not even the beginning, and there were many talks about quitting. However, I wanted to complete the first project somehow, and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to develop development tools. So, even communication disappeared, and I talked to them constantly, and sometimes gathered to relieve the atmosphere by watching alcohol, games, and movies, even if it was not a development meeting. I was motivated to start over with a slightly improved atmosphere, and I threw away the parts to be thrown away and developed or induced them to slightly open the direction. As a result, I completed it somehow at a fixed time. Of course, the result was a very different form from what I thought in the beginning, but I was proud of the relief that I finished it safely. In addition, it was an experience where I realized the importance of preliminary research and communication between team members once again. My first project is games. I formed a team to participate in an on-campus software competition and developed a sports arcade game using MFCs that I was learning at school. At the time of development, I was overwhelmed with game knowledge through a lot of gameplay, but I was frustrated because I was not able to implement those functions. Fortunately, I had a colleague on the team who had some experience, so I learned the basic concept of development with the help of that friend. The second project is also a game, but this time I developed an online action RPG by adding a network function. I have a low understanding of the socket, and I used only one thread, so the server burst frequently. I wanted to develop the server side together, but I didn't have enough time, so I took on the client part. I learned about class design, character movement, and events that I felt was lacking in previous projects. The third project created a game development tool. By developing offline tools first, online for the second time, and production tools for the last time, we gradually expanded our scope of development. While working on the development tool, I had a great difficulty in handling events. There were so many constraints that I did not create a compiler, but ended up using events set by developers rather than allowing users to create various events. While working on the three projects, I felt a lot of shortcomings, and I applied for an NCsoft internship because I wanted to improve myself. First, I want to be the person I need in the team. As I worked on several projects, I felt it was important to complete my part. I want to do my job properly, and if I can afford it, I want to help other team members and become an indispensable person in the team. After that, if I have the opportunity, I want to realize the game I've only imagined in my head while playing the game for the rest of my life, develop my game, and achieve my dream of enjoying it. Even if I don't have a chance to make a new game, I want to put the game of the team I'm in to the top position."
"[KT thinks of customers] The first reason I came to like KT was because of its Wi-Fi. Looking at Oleh Wifi, which is easy to see anywhere in the country, I could feel how much KT thinks of customers. The ideal company for me is a place where I have the ability to think of customers first and provide them with convenience. The only place that fits my ideal was KT. Based on my knowledge of communication major for customers, I want to continue constant communication in the network control/operation team. I have one year of experience as a data input/inspection intern at 'oooooo'. Thanks to my experience at that time, I am confident in detecting and correcting errors. My motivation for supporting KT's network operation/control was to reduce errors one by one for customers and to reduce the inconvenience to zero for customers. [Steady Study] After joining the company, I will continue to study network for the development of KT and I. Since technological advancement evolves faster and faster day by day, I think it is essential to make efforts to provide better services to customers. I will not stay at the current level even after time passes, and in 10 years, I will try to acquire as much knowledge as 10 years from now on. Through this, the goal is to obtain a license for a telecommunications driver in the mid- to long-term, including an information technician, and ultimately to reduce customer discomfort/complaints to zero. [Firm from the basics] I participated in the 'oooooo' club, which is building a house of love, and went to build a house in Yangpyeong from August 23 to 24, 2011. Since it is a house-building club, many of the members of the club majored in architecture. I thought that safety education and wearing safety equipment were essential because it is a construction site that builds a house. However, most of the other club members were insensitive to safety because they thought it was a familiar job, and they did not sincerely try to complete it. Since the construction site is a place that could be dangerous for life, I suggested the 'Safety Education Team' to the president of the club, and I took over as the team leader. Before starting work twice a day in the morning/lunch, I conducted simple stretching, checked wearing safety equipment such as safety helmets, and conducted safety training for safety so that the club members were put into work. Eventually, all club members received safety training, wore safety equipment, started building houses, and were able to return to school safely after completing their volunteer work. No matter how well the house was built, its meaning would have been greatly diluted if someone had been injured. Looking at the members of the architecture club who were insensitive to the safety of the time, I could feel that it was difficult to keep the basics as I got used to it. Just as the first floor needs to be strong so that the second floor does not collapse, as an intern at KT, I will become an intern who prepares and implements the basics firmly. [With my gums] I worked as an administrative soldier when I served in the military, and when I had a communication problem in the office, I asked for help from the communications unit. One day, the TV in the commander's office was cut off from the signal, so I contacted the communications unit, but it did not work out after a long time. In the office, other executives were urging me to resolve the commander's TV, and the communications unit was unable to identify the cause of the problem. As an administrative officer in the office, I came up with another way to prevent damage to the commander. Right away, I solved the problem by connecting the computer to the commander's TV and turning on the broadcast from the computer to the Internet. After solving the problem that day, I was able to solve the original problem by contacting a private company in charge of TV communications. I was able to leave the office without anything happening, and I was able to receive praise from the executives and receive a reward vacation later. I was proud of myself for solving this urgent situation after turning off the lights as a temporary measure. Since many unexpected problems arise in life, and we still have to solve them well, we will continue to respond quickly so that KT's customers do not suffer any damage from temporary measures to finish. [802.11a OFDM Communication Module Design] Since January 2016, I have been designing and implementing 802.11 OFDM wireless communication modules as graduation works. By looking for standard documents, I understand the behavior of the physical and data link layers and understand the structure and proceed with it. If I had learned the theory in the undergraduate class, now I needed to understand the overall communication process and work to improve the performance in order to implement it myself. First, I turned the simulation around through c++ coding to see if it worked properly, and I checked to what extent it can be restored even when noise and delay are added. In the next step, we added the Convolution Endoder and the Viterbi Decoder to reduce BER and PER, and checked how much performance can be improved. There were many difficulties because I had to implement the wireless communication process I learned in theory while I was working on my graduation work and understand the behavior in more detail to be able to code. However, after going through this process, I gained confidence that I would be able to say that I majored in communication. I think a general understanding of communication is essential in order to perform the network job of KT, the representative of telecommunication company, and my experience in direct implementation helped me greatly understand the network. Based on these experiences, I want to develop further in the KT network job."
"[Living Together] When I was in college, I practiced warmth while working as a part-timer in elections. When the work didn't end even after 3 a.m. due to the delay in counting the votes at the time of the part-time job, most of the students went back home using class as an excuse. I also had to go back home for an afternoon class, but the election watchdog staff caught my eye. I thought that if all the part-timers left, the rest of us would be many times more difficult, so I decided to stay together until the end. I fell asleep to the work that lasted all night, but each time, I went to the bathroom and washed my face with cold water, chasing after my drowsiness. After 9 p.m., everything was over, and I was served a bowl of warm rice soup with thank you from the person in charge. It was an experience where I was more physically challenged than others, but I was full of pride in being grateful to someone. I will be a new employee who actively practices followership even with Dow Technology. [Mission: Complete Your Graduation Work] When I was in college, I worked on a project to make a drone that helped me tour the campus with three colleagues. Since it was my first time encountering drones, there were many trials and errors in production. Contrary to the initial plan, additional parts were continuously generated while making the drone, which delayed the construction of the drone even with a month left before the deadline. The team members were feeling pressure due to lack of time, tired of repeated flight failures, and losing motivation. First, I suggested to the team members how to solve the problem through cooperation and motivation to do it. In addition to the existing areas, I gave them the role of supporting other team members so that they could cooperate with each other. On weekends, I visited clubs to learn how to set the basics for flying and how to operate the controller, so I was able to fly simultaneously with the production. As a result of helping each other in their fields step by step in line with the new plan, I was able to complete the project within the deadline. While you may face difficult problems while working on IT at Dow Technology, you will become a wise new employee who solves problems with a challenging attitude and goal setting. [Financial Services Convergence Training for New Human Resources] The ooo IT Education Center conducted a project to build an account management service for the team in pairs. I was in charge of designing the structure of the program and making data flow smoothly. What I thought was important while working on the project was safety and simplicity. As it was a money-related project, I put security first. When dealing with customer's personal information data, we encrypted important data through CAESAR encryption and used the post method when transmitting the data. In addition, in order to provide easy service, we used a unique value of mobile phone number as ID, minimizing the data that needs to be inputted. It was a small project, but I think it was an opportunity to indirectly experience what kind of development work I should focus on in the future as a programmer. If I join Dow Technology and participate in web application development, I will eventually become a programmer who always thinks about what kind of service is for my customers. [Habit of rewatching the light off -> Trust] The task given to me is to check every little thing meticulously. Some people say, ""Isn't it okay to move on?"" But I think it's consideration for the other person and trust with the other person to not make mistakes by checking many times. When I worked as a student at the university headquarters, I was in charge of transferring money to the total cost of issuing my certificates. I have made a habit of checking my income, expenditure, and balance more than three times in order not to make mistakes because I am dealing with public money. One day, when I found out that the balance was relatively small in the sum of the issuance costs, I informed the person in charge of the fact and took measures to correct the cost. Before transferring money, I was able to check the previous settlement of accounts and correct the wrong parts without any major problems, and I have come to be recognized as a reliable person by the person in charge. This thoroughness will serve as the basis for realizing a program that does not have errors in the web application service development work. [""Dream"" List""] My goal in life is to live a dream-like life. When I was in the military, I read a book called ""Don't Stop Stop, Start Writing Your Dream Again"" and reflected on the past days when I had only studied without any goals. Then, I started writing down the dreams I wanted to achieve one by one in my notebook. These dreams are written in various ways, ranging from small dreams such as volunteering for my neighbors in need, traveling alone, traveling the bicycle country, to the long-term dream of living around the world, and preparing a house in Seoul. These dreams are the driving force for me to live passionately. I gain confidence that I can do it by looking at the dreams I have achieved, and I am doing a compass in my life to remind myself of my goals. Also, I think dreams always come true. Even if it is a reckless dream, I believe it will come true, and if I take one step closer to my dream, I think my dream is half-achieved, just like the saying, ""The beginning is half."" Currently, my dream is to join Dow Technology. As an intern at Dow Technology, I am confident that I will be selected as a new employee by performing a given task more passionately than anyone else. Even after joining Dow Technology, I will continue to challenge myself toward my dreams and create the best life in the best company. Please give me a chance to realize my dream. [SNS Form and Shared Growth] I got to know a company called Dow Technology through my junior who experienced an internship in Dow Technology QA department. I heard that it is a solid company with diverse and stable business models in the Internet service field. I did not know much about it because there are more businesses targeting B2B than B2C, but I found out that the services I have actually used such as UNICRO and payment agency are those provided by Dow Technology. I want to join Dow Technology and work on SNS Form development. I think it is a service that understands the needs of customers well with the catchphrase 'Anyone can easily and conveniently use SNS shopping platform'.In an era when the boundaries between sellers and buyers are blurred and anyone can become a seller, I think easy and fast social platforms are attractive services to individual customers. I will become a new employee who is growing up with SNS Form by participating in the SNS activation contest of shopping mall A, listening to customers and drawing out needs, and using my experience in payment-related projects in the process of converging financial services."
"1. While taking object-oriented programming A+ and programming classes, I became interested in WEP/APP development as I realized that the process of making and modifying programs is similar to the process of solving math problems that I have liked since I was young. 2. Database design A0, I learned how to use the language and programs needed to design the database and analyze big data. 3. I took Computer Graphics Design A0, Computer Graphics Design course, and I learned how to use Computer Graphics by creating 3D space and creating objects using OpenGL. I took the Big Data Manager course run by the Koreaoo Association to design databases such as Java, Oracle, Hadoop, and R, and learned the language and how to use the programs needed to analyze big data. Also, I was not satisfied with simply taking classes, and I was able to get the experience I needed for actual use by conducting a mini-project every time I learned a program, and I am working on a graduation project to design a database related to patents and a system that searches for the desired information in them. Since NHN Entertainment is a company that provides IT services based on life and culture, I think it is most important to develop programs that many users can conveniently use. After joining the company, I will try to produce performance that satisfies users to develop programs that customers need, not simply to develop to produce results."
"After graduating from high school, I came back to prepare for college. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but most of all, I didn't want to put a financial burden on my parents, so I had a lot of worries. I gathered a lot of information to find out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to work as a work scholarship and take classes. When I think about it now, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that involve as few as 100 people and as many as 300 people were divided among 20 work scholars, and before the class started, 20 work such as chalking for lectures and checking the status of the microphone was done together. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there were situations where several classrooms overlapped to prepare. However, the work scholarship students not only did their job, but also took the time to help each other to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. I was able to have valuable experiences to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to cooperate while working as a student at a college for nearly a year. In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed problem-solving and collaboration skills by efficiently utilizing the semester and vacation to engage in various activities such as competitions, participation in hackathon competitions, and overseas clubs. In particular, during the semester, I participated in software competitions every year by setting the goal of winning the award by selecting the skills and services I wanted to study and make. I achieved my goals every year and won the competition in both 2015 and 2016. While taking school class, I studied new skills on my own and worked on a project, so I was burdened with time, but I think the reason I was able to succeed was because I enjoyed it. I was able to have fun while studying the skills I wanted to use and completing the projects one by one through those skills. In addition, when I encountered difficulties in unknown errors while developing, I was able to develop my ability to solve problems by solving them by myself by searching the Internet step by step with the error door as a clue. I am confident that I was able to succeed as a synergy effect because I studied what I wanted to do and had fun in the process, not because it was mandatory. My motivation for applying for ""The Zone Bizon"" was to think that the appearance of constant challenges matched my values. In addition, I was convinced that the competencies I had prepared so far were optimized for the ERP/web development job in ""The Zone Bizon"". In order to build my competence as a developer, I have developed important collaboration skills and problem-solving skills as a developer by efficiently utilizing semesters and vacations through various activities such as external clubs, competition awards, and hackathon competitions. When I do web projects through various projects through php, jsp model 2, spring framework, I have accumulated the concepts and capabilities necessary for web projects. Currently, I am learning a sense of practice by developing a sponsor system used by universities through the spring framework, and I think the experience of the sponsor management program, which develops functions for work in the university development room, is a miniature version of ERP development. Therefore, I am confident that the process and development logic experienced while planning and developing will enable me to quickly adapt to the ERP/WEB development department and faithfully perform my duties to contribute to the project. During my college life, I participated in joint development clubs, competitions, hackathon competitions, and other projects with my colleagues. I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills through various activities, such as completing the results in 3 days and 2 nights by working with first-timers right away. While working on projects with office workers and designers through the joint club, I was able to discuss ideas and learn UI/UX from the perspective of weak users by having meetings with designers. In addition, while developing with an office worker who is developing in practice, I was able to learn parts that are difficult for students to understand, such as RSS parsing and effective code laws. Currently, we are developing a system that is outsourced to a ""supporters' association management system"" and uses it immediately upon completion of development. We discussed the requirements through a month-long meeting with the staff, coordinated and documented each other, and designed the client part of the system and the database. After the database design was completed, we are completing the development by dividing the roles with the team members. I am confident that the web development department will be able to quickly adapt, faithfully fulfill its role, and contribute to the improvement of the entire ""Djohn Bizon"" and service."

I am confident that I am second to none in terms of technical skills, responsibility, and patience that a developer should have. I will make the best of my abilities and meet the expectations of NICE information and communication. Since I was young, I have been praised for having a unique idea by surprising people around me by drawing pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others have never imagined. I was interested in programming that allowed me to freely realize these unique ideas and naturally went on to major in computer engineering. In order to develop a new concept of service that others could not come up with, I tried to build up my competence as a developer by completing a number of programming expert courses at oo Academy, an educational institution for development experts as well as majoring in university. As the first step in surprising the world with unique ideas, I founded a fashion shopping mall called 'OO' a year ago. We tried to provide the trust and convenience of customers through the operation method called 'pre-check payment after payment', which is differentiated from the existing shopping mall called 'pre-check after payment'. In addition, through the concept of providing personalized styling services, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls and targeted niche markets by targeting men rather than women as our main customer base. Naturally, this became the first opportunity in the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling services for men, and returns and refunds have occurred at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up for SK Planet.However, despite these achievements, I encountered unexpected difficulties while developing the service due to the disadvantage of trying to solve any problem alone. During the implementation of the payment system, the PHP-based code sample and manual provided by the payment PG company were very different from the server platform Node.js, which I implemented, which was difficult to implement. I tried to search for PHP programming books and the Internet, but I wasted five days. Eventually, I asked the payment PG for help, and I felt a great sense of despondency when I learned that it was a problem that could be solved simply in a day. As a result, when a problem arises, I try to solve it quickly by approaching anyone first, asking them, and learning. Although there were many difficulties while developing the service due to its shortcomings, the responsibility of being 'the owner of the service is me' was the driving force that led to the commercialization of the shopping mall service. It was not easy to develop the service's front/back-end alone because I was the only developer in a start-up team composed of various majors. However, this start-up started with my idea, and after staying up all night in the office for three months with a sense of responsibility that no one else could take charge of development, I was able to implement and commercialize the service within the target period. Through the start-up of a fashion shopping mall, I practiced 'passion' and 'challenge' by creating the first male personal styling service that was not found in existing shopping malls, and I decided that the 'professionalism' of running out of school to develop a solid service and entering a development professional education institution directly matched NICE's talent image and applied."
"I think there is a great potential for the development of financial it. Recently, the domestic financial industry has eased a lot of regulations on it, but it is being incorporated in various ways. So I thought that the job of financial it has a great potential for development and I will be able to expand my capabilities. The new future of financial it, which is the vision of Lotte Capital, is the same as the dream I want to achieve in my job. Lotte Capital's goal is to develop new and diverse financial products using information and communication technology to meet the diverse needs of consumers, thereby enhancing the benefits of society as a whole, and I applied to Lotte Capital because I thought it would be great if I could demonstrate my capabilities and support them. I will try to exert a higher synergy effect by adding Lotte Capital's capabilities, such as segmented financial products and leased products, and my capabilities in business administration/it. I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I began to study far away. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, he said, ""I believe in you. I was able to work with my family because I believed in you. He said, ""Don't trust me in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. However, I lacked the basics and I spent a year re-offending life after I was a high school senior. There is something I gained by successfully spending that year. It is self-control. I studied according to the set rules every day for a year. It was very difficult to study a set time and a set amount every day. But I thought it was a promise to myself and studied hard for a year. So I think I gained high self-control through re-examination. I have developed a strong mental strength to overcome long project tasks or intense tasks in my job at Lotte Capital it. [Eye-level Education] I was able to learn how to think from the other person's point of view when I provide after-school educational services to children in need at home. Children who have difficulty at home cannot go to private academies, so they receive after-school education at social welfare centers run by local governments or volunteer organizations. I did educational services to children in elementary and middle schools during the vacation at Yeonmu Welfare Center and Seongmin Social Welfare Center. When I first met them, they were very wary of me. So I asked my teacher how I could make friends with them. She said I should look at them from their perspective. In the next volunteer class, I brought chocolates, gave them a quiz, and gave them a gift. After doing this, the children approached me without hesitation. Through this experience, I realized that when I treat children, I have to look at them from their perspective. When I tried to teach them right away because I went to educational service, they felt burdened. First of all, I needed time to get close to my children, and in order to get close, I had to think from their perspective. Through this process, I think the same is true when dealing with customers. I think the process of thinking about what convenience and benefits will be from the customer's point of view is an essential process to perform an IT job. First, I studied the web, Java, and DB while working on a shopping mall production project using JSP and MYSQL, who have accumulated sufficient capabilities. In this process, I was able to learn password encryption and error page processing that I did not know in the past, and I studied how several pages were organically combined. Second, a steady researcher completed the course of oracle database sql/workshop1/2 over a month in February 2016, and studied the architecture of db and various memories in oracle db for efficiently constructing sql. In addition, during the weekend of March and June, I completed a curriculum called analyzing security weaknesses through mock hacking, and used linux to penetrate the server and analyze which part was vulnerable. Even after graduating from school, I am constantly developing myself and building up my capabilities. I have the advantage of being able to understand the other person's intentions well. At the time of the scout intern, I was asked to do short research in a short time. Although I did not have enough time, I set my own standards and researched them according to my priorities. Through this experience, I will find and deal with tasks with them first among many tasks with a high priority. On the other hand, my weakness is the lack of efficient time distribution for multiple tasks. I learned this at university and after that, I put a time limit on one task. So, when there is a set time, I perform other tasks to prevent myself from being overly immersed in one task. These efforts have led to fewer mistakes even when I have to handle tasks at the same time. First of all, in the beginning of the job, I will finish studying information security that I am currently studying, and after that, I will figure out the work and think about how to melt what I learned in the department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also create experiences in the business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' tasks are handled due to the nature of financial it. In addition, in the it sector, which has up to it 4 teams, we will actively interact with other teams to promote unity of the it team, and through the synergy effect, higher work efficiency and information sharing are possible. The it job always has to think about optimal efficiency and how to reduce cost and time in the process. I think that in order to achieve this, the it team should have more information about other departments and also more information sharing between the it team."
"The person who made the biggest difference in my life is my father. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I started to keep away from studying. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, my father said, ""I trust you. I have been able to work with my family because I believe in you. I told him not to trust him in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. Since then, I have tried not to break promises with others and myself. Not only am I not late for the appointment with my friends, but I also focused on completing the study time I set myself. As a result, I succeeded in my re-examination and I was able to grow into a responsible person who gives trust to others. I think securities are the flower of the economy. I think all kinds of elements of the economy come together to form a stock market, and stocks come together to form a stock market. The first reason I became interested in securities was after learning about option investment in one of my major classes. I became more interested in securities by making a simulation investment that created synthetic options. I will figure out my work and think about how I can incorporate what I learned in my department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future tasks, I will not only study programming languages but also have experience in business together. This is because it is difficult to pursue efficiency if you do not know how other departments' work is handled due to the nature of finance it. Based on these efforts, I will maximize the synergy effect of the it team in 10 years to make Shinyoung Securities a leader in the finance it world. I have the experience of overcoming crises with my active attitude. When I was in college, I worked as a group supporter. One of the supporters' activities was to distribute wet wipes and fans only to citizens who took the quiz. However, the planned day was so hot that citizens were not interested in us. The team members' motivation also declined. So I came up with an idea by taking the lead in order to increase the team members' motivation and successfully finish the mission. They didn't give us a gift when we got the quiz right, but they made some changes by giving us a gift first and giving a quiz. The citizens who received the gift didn't turn away from us. In just one hour, we filled out all the number of quizzes we wanted. I took the lead in solving the team's problems and encouraged my team members by offering opinions. Throughout my life, I have found that giving active opinions on something can be a clue to a solution, even if it is not the perfect answer. My outlook on life is 'Let's live a life looking around.' I had this outlook on life because of my experience living in the country. I went to elementary school in the country, and the most memorable teacher was the teacher who was in charge when I was in the fourth grade. Knowing that my father was on a long business trip abroad at the time, the teacher treated me like he was, and I was able to listen to him and build my self-reliance. Although I lost contact now, at that time, I thought that when I grew up, I wanted to help children like you. So I joined a university and spent my vacation doing volunteer work. I have experience in volunteer work while teaching elementary and middle school students at Seongmin Social Welfare Center and Yeonmu Welfare Center. I enjoyed the time to meet with children while volunteering, and I was even more happy if the children understood the concept properly. Through volunteer work, I raised my self-esteem and became more responsible in my life. I remember playing the role of PM in designing the project the most. I have experience in carrying out a parking lot management project in my major class, System Analysis and Design. I designed scenarios for each process and carefully analyzed how the system was executed. The biggest difficulty in the project was the difficulty in communicating between team members. For example, everyone agreed on the opinion of A, but it turned out that team members knew A as A+ or A-, not A. As this happened repeatedly, confusion occurred among team members. So I later created a terminology summary file to prevent confusion in the project. Through this experience, I learned that even colleagues who are handling the same task may have different views. Based on this, if I work on a project at Shinyoung Securities, I will be passionate and share accurate information with my colleagues to help me with the project. The most memorable thing is that I did a shopping mall project using JSP in system design and analysis. Implementing shopping mall sites for each team was a task at the end of the semester. Our team built a web server using JSP, AJAX's jQuery, mysql, and tomcat at the time. At that time, three people divided the JSP page, script page, and dbbean page and were in charge of each other. I remember gradually completing the homepage during the semester, and when the semester was over, I was impressed with my team members when I saw that the homepage that ran properly was completed. The reason this project was most memorable was that the professor told me that our team's shopping mall was implemented the most properly. It is because the various variables and page names exchanged between pages were set up intuitively and easily recognized."
"Looking back on myself, I think I always liked learning new things. I liked sports since I was young, so I learned various sports. When I was in college, I also joined a club and worked out. In the second year, I wanted to learn a field other than my major, so I learned a job through marketing school. After learning the job, I applied it to the field and worked, and after graduation, I wanted to harmonize with my major, so I interned. There, I experienced not only the marketing work, but also the culture and social life of the company through various experiences in the field and conversations with colleagues. Finally, I did research on processing big data as the subject of the graduation project before graduation. Usually, other students proceed with the project with what they learned in their undergraduate school, such as making an application or making a web as a graduation project. However, my team member and I decided to proceed with this topic because we wanted to study big data, which is a hot issue, not what we learned in the undergraduate school. I decided to work on the project by choosing each role with my team members, but it was not something I learned in undergraduate school, so I had a hard time in the middle because of difficulties from the installation process, but I was able to overcome the difficulties thanks to the team members who asked for advice from professors and graduate school seniors, studied and researched together. My major is computer engineering, and it is a software-oriented class, so I could take a lot of SW-related classes. The SW-related subjects I took are object-oriented programming, system software, Java programming, computer graphics, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and database. Among them, the class I was interested in was called database application, which I learned in the 4th grade. Through that class, I was able to first encounter DB, and at the same time, I was able to help me understand the big data that was in progress as a graduation project. I was able to practice 3-4 of DB-related software, and I was able to learn how to model DB (requirement analysis, normalization, and ER diagram) by choosing one application. I think big data is the most valuable industry these days. I think the value varies greatly depending on how much data a company has and how much data it can use. Accordingly, I am confident that I will be able to become an employee that Humax expects through learning through various programming and graduation projects learned in the undergraduate school. After listening to marketing training before taking a leave of absence, I always thought, 'I want to be a creative engineer.' However, my major is computer engineering, not marketing, so I wanted to work in marketing. So, after taking a leave of absence, I started an internship in sales support and marketing at an IT solution company in 2013. When I first started working, the department in charge was newly established, so there was no framework. First of all, I thought that my understanding of the company was my top priority, so I studied IT solutions. Also, I didn't forget to read and study marketing-related books because there were many things I didn't know about the marketing field. After that, I announced the schedule through weekly meetings. I worked on revising the homepage, producing and sending eDM, producing and guiding promotions, and working on documents. I had never done anything except document work, so I studied, searched, and made it by myself. As a result, even before I finished my internship, my boss suggested me to change to a full-time job as well as raise my salary. I am a person who always tries and challenges to achieve what I want. Even after joining Humax, I will always try and challenge myself with a constant mind. Since I was young, I have been told that I am mature for my age due to my deep thought and consideration. However, I have a fiery personality when it comes to things that I don't think are right. Because of this, I misunderstand that my personality is not good, but when I look at it two or three times, everyone knows and understands the reason. However, I always try to fix it because I know that it is a bad thing to make people misunderstand. When I started interning at work after taking a leave of absence, I had weekly reports and team meetings through weekly meetings. At first, the weekly meeting was burdensome, so I summarized it briefly and proceeded quickly. However, the reason for the meeting is to share opinions with others and receive feedback from each other, so I organized the materials for the meeting the day before. And when I start working, I am doing my job as accurately and quickly as possible. I ask my seniors about things I don't know and search for materials on my own to work. Because of this reason, I think I worked full-time when I was an intern."
"The reason I applied for ""SureSoft Tech"" was that I applied in line with the values of preparing for a new leap by constantly preparing for innovation without stopping at my current position. At the same time, I was convinced that the job competencies I had accumulated in activities such as external activities, competitions, and competitions were suitable for my job. While collaborating with various people, I have been working on various projects through technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework, and I have gained experience by solidly studying technologies and concepts. In addition, when winning the mobile application implemented using hybrid app technology at the App Competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, I was proved my job competencies that I have accumulated so far. I am confident that I can contribute by quickly learning and adapting to work at ""SureSoft Tech"" through various experiences along with such consistent values. If I have a title while working after joining the company, I would like to receive a second name as ""a developer who provides stable services."" As I develop, I think it is good and important to develop a program while applying new technologies while following the flow of technology. However, the most important thing while using the program is to provide stable services to users with fewer errors, and I think the more important the service is to provide useful information to many people. Therefore, I will study the service performance necessary to develop stable services while learning and learning the work properly through the experiences and capabilities I have gained. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable services. Therefore, I deeply studied java programming through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable services to customers by building up the ability for stable services by working as a SW inspection at ""Suresoft Tech,"" and I will grow up preparing for the future with ""Suresoft Tech."" After graduating from high school, I challenged the college entrance exam once again. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through the academy, but more than anything, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about many things. After gathering a lot of information, I came to understand that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and after the interview, I was able to take classes while working as a work scholarship student. Looking back, the first step in society was working at the 20-year-old cram school. Twenty scholarships shared roles in classes where as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students participated, and before the class started, 20 students worked together on cleaning up the class, including chalking and microphone status checks. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures taking place, there were situations where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, I came to realize that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together by taking the time to help each other, as well as doing what they were assigned to. I was able to learn about my ability to organize, responsibility, and cooperation while living as a student at a college academy for nearly a year. Also, I was able to realize that it depends on what kind of situation I think it is and that it can be a valuable experience depending on my actions. I am confident that I can always use this mindset to contribute to the development of the service of ""Suresoft Tech."" It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I have solved the questions. As an example, I was interested in the technologies I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I heard a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance who is working in practice. It was a technology that is used a lot in practice and is mostly used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't fall asleep that I ended up turning on my laptop and looking for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using the technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to the project based on the data I looked up. Thus, I did not finish solving my questions but applied them to personal projects, and in the process of applying them to personal projects, I organized them once more and posted them on my blog to make sure that what I studied in the process of applying them to personal projects. I became interested in using RSS after seeing that I used a lot of RSS around me, so I did a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there was a problem that I had no experience in spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. Since it is my first time in the case of spring, I thought it would be good to proceed based on reference materials, so I asked the professor to study the materials that the seniors conducted in class. I applied the parts that were not in the reference materials to the project by filling in the gaps by searching the Internet and referring to the information on the community site. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS, and I asked my acquaintances I knew while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looking for it, and I found that fetching information through RSS was also a kind of parsing. I searched the Internet with the keyword parsing, and I tested it starting with html parsing. Later, I found a library called Jsoup and successfully used it to get the information I wanted through RSS and use it in the format I wanted.After importing and processing the information, I thought it would be better to summarize the article and show only the important parts, so I thought it would be better to implement and apply the paragraph summary algorithm myself. I thought about what to do with the logic of the paragraph summary algorithm, and eventually, I prioritized the paragraphs through checking the frequency and frequency of words, implemented the algorithm, and applied it to the information that was imported by parsing. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to achieve the desired results by solving them one by one. I could feel once again that if I was willing to do something that was difficult while working on the project, there must be a way. We have prepared a public data contest to take on a new challenge through the capabilities we have accumulated so far. In the process of planning, the team members thought a lot about what kind of novel service to make using public data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. While looking for good public data to use, I found public data related to livestock diseases, and I thought about how it would be possible to find animal diseases directly through the symptoms identified through the user's naked eyes. I immediately looked into whether there was a service on the subject of human diseases, but found out that there was no animal and livestock-related disease service. I immediately presented my opinions to the team members and received positive responses from other team members, so I decided to choose the core service as the subject of animal and livestock diseases. In addition, by adding a function that directly shows the nearby animal hospital and a service that informs you of the latest epidemic in real time, we launched a service called ""My Own Veterinarian"" and received the second prize in the competition. While working on several projects, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking skills are very important. For example, if you write a code that adds up by adding 1 to 10, it is usually implemented through repetitive sentences, but if algorithmic thinking ability and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying a method such as an equal sequence rather than a repetitive sentence. As a result, we gathered people to learn algorithms every week to achieve algorithmic consumption. Each person solves algorithm problems for a set amount of time, takes turns reviewing the code, and analyzing the other person's code. Like this, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I could not think of when I studied alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Turning crises into opportunities is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I tried again for college entrance exams. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to burden my parents financially, so I had to think about it. I wanted to make money from part-time jobs by focusing on studying as much as possible, but after gathering a lot of information, I found out that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college academy, and I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student after an interview. Now that I think about it, the working life of the 20-year-old re-examination academy was the first step in society. Classes that require as many as 100 students and as many as 300 students were divided into roles, and before the class started, 20 scholarships worked together to clean up the class, such as chalking and microphone status checking. Particularly during the vacation period, many lectures were held, and more students than students came to take famous lectures on a regular basis. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms that had to be prepared overlapped. However, the labor scholarship students took the time to help each other, not only to do their job, but also to solve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force that can solve difficulties together. I had a valuable experience to learn the ability to organize, to be responsible, and to work together while I was a labor scholarship student at the college for nearly a year. [Curious, meticulous, and immersed!] It is a strength of my personality to immerse myself in challenging myself until I can solve the questions. As an example, I was interested in the skills I normally use in practice and emerging technologies, so I was told a technology called log4j while talking to an acquaintance working in practice. It was a technology that is widely used in practice and used by practitioners, but it was unfamiliar at the time. After returning home, I was so curious that I couldn't sleep, so I turned on my laptop and looked for related materials. As a result of looking it up, I found out that there were a lot of materials and that it was a bug-related technology, and recently, I found out that I am using a more complementary technology called logback more. As I learned the main purpose of using technology and the current flow of use, my curiosity was solved, but I had a desire to apply it to a project based on the data I looked for. Thus, I did not end up solving my curiosity, but applied it to my personal project, and in the process of applying it to my personal project, I organized it one more time and posted it on my blog to make sure that what I had studied was my own, and then fell asleep. The downside is that focusing on one thing takes precedence in everything. In order to compensate for my shortcomings, I am making my shortcomings a strength by prioritizing whether there is anything more important before I start and putting them into action. Along with thorough management to check the priorities of work, I will focus on ideas and recent technologies that can improve the service of the ""Hankook Ilbo"" to prepare for the future and use them to grow together. [Best friends to match the ""Hankook Ilbo""!] Satisfied with its current position, the ""Hankook Ilbo"" has provided services to customers with a clear direction and goal and has developed without stopping. As such, we have supported the values that we challenge with sustainable growth and the mindset for our customers. In the Hankook Ilbo, I have accumulated the necessary job competencies as an IT developer through various activities such as external activities, contests, and contests. Through various technologies such as php, jsp, and spring framework with various people such as office workers, designers, planners, etc., I was able to develop my problem-solving skills and collaboration skills. In addition, I have gained experience by studying the technologies and concepts necessary for web development by intensively working on web projects. In addition, I studied hybrid app technology and received the award by opening my own veterinarian service by challenging at an app competition hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. I am confident that these accumulated job competencies can be used to quickly build small-scale mobile services through hybrid apps, and that I can contribute to providing quick and stable services to customers through the development and development of web services. [Developer who provides stable web services!] After deciding on a career path, I have developed the concept and development ability of the web by focusing on web projects through various activities and challenges such as development clubs, contests, and competitions. That's why I am confident that I will be able to display my skills even more when I work on web development. If I join the Hankook Ilbo and develop a service in charge of web development, I will become a developer who provides stable service to customers. While developing, it is important to follow the flow of technology while applying new technologies, but I think the most important thing is to provide stable service to users with fewer errors. Therefore, I will focus on studying and developing the service performance necessary to develop stable service while learning and learning the work correctly through the accumulated experience and capabilities. This is because the implementation of efficient performance leads to stable service. Therefore, I even studied Java programming deeply by myself through a book called ""Java Performance Tuning."" After joining the company, I will provide more convenient and stable service to customers through my immersion in technology for stable service, and I will prepare and grow for the future with the Hankook Ilbo. [Algebraic Consumption!] While working on the project, I learned that the ability and knowledge to develop are important, but algorithmic thinking ability is very important. For example, if you write a code that adds 1 to 10 to obtain a sum, you usually use repetitions, but if algorithmic thinking and experience are added, you can come up with a code that improves temporal performance by applying an equi-order sequence rather than repetitions. As a result, we gathered people to create our own algorithmic consumption and conducted algorithm learning every week.Each of them is studying while analyzing the other's code while taking turns reviewing the code after solving algorithm problems for a set amount of time. As such, I was able to develop my thinking ability by seeing the implementation method that I couldn't think of when studying alone, and I am growing more through constant meetings."
"[Choice and concentration] My first choice is to have various part-time job experiences such as cafes, movie theaters, pubs, and office assistants. There were times when I felt physically and mentally difficult while studying and economic activities at the same time, but I faithfully performed it with a sense of responsibility for my work. Because of this sense of responsibility, I have been steadily doing what I started once by building trust for more than six months. Especially when I was working part-time at a movie theater, I actively welcomed customers thinking about what kind of service I wanted to receive from the customer's point of view, and I got the unexpected result of ""being kind and smiling."" The second choice and concentration was studying. In fact, even until the second year, after spending time due to vague about career path, I started to pay attention to web development-related fields in the second half of the second year. I focused on my studies, feeling that I lacked basic skills, but there were limitations. However, as I came to think about ways to improve my practical skills without giving up, I was able to broaden my experience through activities of the joint development club, and I have developed collaboration skills and problem-solving skills that are important to developers by using competitions and blogs. As a result, I was able to raise my GPA from 3.0 to 3.41, and I was able to develop not only my academic performance but also my competency required for my work. As such, the sense of accomplishment gained through the goals established through the selection and concentration was a valuable experience that could not be exchanged for anything else. I am sure that such selection and concentration will show efficient and successful results by focusing on the task assigned to the ""Simplex Internet."" [What turns a crisis into an opportunity is the spirit of challenge.] After graduating from high school, I decided to retake the class. I wanted to make up for my lack of study through an academy, but more than anything else, I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, so I had to think about it. As I wanted to earn money by focusing on studying as much as possible, I learned that there is a system that allows me to take classes for free while working at a college, and after an interview, I was able to take classes while working as a scholarship student. Now that I think about it, working at the 20-year-old cram school was the first step in society. Twenty scholarship students shared roles in classes with as few as 100 students and as many as 300 students, and before the class started, they worked together on cleaning up the lecture's chalk and microphone status. Particularly during the vacation, many lectures were held, and more students than students usually came to take famous lectures. Due to the large number of lectures held, there was a situation where several classrooms to prepare overlapped. However, the scholarship students took the time to help each other, not just do their job, but took the time to resolve the shortage of manpower, and realized that cooperation is a strong force to solve difficulties together. While I was working as a student at a college for nearly a year, I had a valuable experience to learn about organizing skills, responsibility, and cooperation. I am confident that the organizing ability, responsibility, and cooperation learned through the growth process must strengthen the bond between the ""Simplex Internet"" and create synergy to increase work efficiency and contribute to it. The strength of my personality is that I am responsible for what I decide. After entering university, I became the first-year representative of the department. While playing a public role, I personally wanted to help my classmates. As I was taking the class, I found that my classmates, who entered the required liberal arts course called ""college mathematics"" from liberal arts in high school, had difficulty keeping up with the class. I started to post the solutions on the cafe by solving the materials and problems that I had organized every week, and I posted and shared the organized materials for friends in need to refer to them by setting a period and time. It wasn't easy because it wasn't a one-time event, but I exchanged information through the cafe without missing out, and I received a ""thank you"" from my friends who helped me. On the other hand, I was told that I was sad that I was neglected by meetings with my friends due to my strong responsibility for work. I tried to make a habit of taking notes carefully on my calendar and notepad in order to overcome the part of neglecting other tasks when I started working and was immersed in it, so that I could pay attention to the details. In addition, I communicated by saying the circumstances in which I was neglected by my friends, and I contacted my friends first to actively respond, so that I could solve them wisely. [You have to get together!] Until now, I have lived with the mind of ""Let's grow together while helping."" Although it may be easy to see it simply, the word ""Let's grow together while helping"" has a lot of meaning and requires a lot of effort. You need a sense of responsibility to faithfully fulfill your role through role division, and you also need to be supportive of persistence to keep responsibility. Helping others is because you need passion to help while doing your part. It takes a lot of effort like this, but it's because I have my own values that are confident that being together while helping can create synergy with each other and lead to good results. That's why even when I'm working on a team project, I've been working hard to become a person who can help by studying about the project more than others. [A challenging developer] In order to build my competence as a developer, I voluntarily participated in a development club during the vacation and carried out the project. During the semester, I tried to communicate through various experiences while challenging a software competition. Among them, I was able to improve my skills through competitions and hackathon. During the semester, we prepared for the competition held at the university under the theme of ""Web Service for Club Introduction and Support"" in groups of two. The server was developed with an MVC structure, jsp (model 2). Since I had never learned JSP and there was a fixed period for submitting results, I stayed until late at night after school class and studied the shortcomings by reading the Internet and books during the service planning to participate in the competition.I proceeded with the project with tension because I had to complete and present for three months while studying with two people. At this time, I was able to understand the concept of MVC structure and develop my ability to use Internet search. In addition, I was able to experience how the programming called Java, which I learned in school, was applied and used in the project. As a result of concentrating on it, I fell in love with it so passionately that it felt like the period was short, and I even got an unexpected award. And the sense of accomplishment came to me as a value more than effort. In addition, by participating in the hackathon held for two nights and three days, I developed the ability to quickly apply the language I studied by developing a web service that shares street performance information with developers, designers, and planners through PHP. I am sure that the ability that I have developed steadily will quickly adapt as a family to the ""Simplex Internet"" and become one and play my role as one, while at the same time being able to help others."
"[passion, curiosity, and sense of accomplishment] The reason why I want to become an S/W developer is because it burns my passion. First, the desire to conquer when a problem is difficult and the sense of accomplishment when I solve it add fuel to my passion. Especially when I implement a difficult algorithm. Sometimes there are moments when development is difficult, but each time, the desire to conquer burns up and I cannot sleep because I am curious until it is resolved. When the development is completed and the test is completed perfectly without any problems, the joy that comes from it cannot be said. I am interested in technologies and trends that I use often in practice, so I often talked about them with a friend who works in IT. One time, I heard a bug-related technology called log4j on the way home together. It is a technology that is used for sure in practice, but it was unfamiliar and I was curious at that time. I couldn't sleep because I was curious about it when I got home, so I turned on my laptop, looked for a site that had a good organization about log4j through the Internet, and the questions were solved, but as the questions were solved, I wanted to apply them to my personal projects. While searching the Internet for information necessary to apply it and applying it to personal projects, I learned the trend of using it as a secured logback in recent log4j, so I applied it as a logback, organized it on my personal blog, and fell asleep. When I have a question or a block, I find a solution, think about it, and I feel very proud. I will grow into an S/W developer by creating synergies through development that can pour oil into my sense of accomplishment and my passion and curiosity. [The moment I realized the importance of teamwork and consideration!] I carried out a study-type project for three months under the theme of ""Men's Management System,"" which targets cosmetics and perfume tastes. I thought that appearance is also competitive, so I wanted to proceed with a customized program that reflects the characteristics of men who hate complicated things. As it was my first project, I wanted to work harder than anyone else, and I wanted to be a team member who could help within the team. When we had a meeting on the ideas of the project, we actively suggested recommending cosmetics and perfumes optimized for the options set by male users according to the male management era. The team responded positively and decided on a men's care service by combining the opinion that the service should be provided with a men's barber shop. In addition, we gathered once more on a weekday other than the mandatory weekend hours to organize our mentors' contents and provide feedback time, so we presented our opinions. The team members also received this opinion positively, and our team had a team meeting time on weekdays. However, while working on a project, one of the team members suddenly went out. Since I was in the middle of a project, I was worried that there were many risks in completing the service within a fixed period of time to schedule and start again, and the atmosphere would be loosened for the team. I thought that someone should organize quickly in such a embarrassing situation, so I said I would play a role in the number of people who volunteered to leave. The increase in the role could have been a burden, but I was confident because I wanted to help my team members and prepared hard before starting full-scale development. During the development process, I borrowed books from the library for reference, but I searched the Internet for answers and asked an acquaintance who was good at development to take time for advice in person. I was able to finish it by solving these obstacles one by one and applying them to the project within a set period of time. In the end, I was able to complete a men's management web service that recommends the best product by selecting the options you want, such as price and function. [Voluntary challenge! Personal project! Summary Article Service] I was interested in using RSS after seeing that I used it a lot, so I have done a personal project using RSS. While working on the project, there were problems that I had no experience with spring and that RSS was unfamiliar. In the case of spring, since it was my first time, I thought it would be good to receive reference materials and proceed with them, so I asked the professor to study the materials that seniors had conducted in class. While looking at the reference materials, I set an overall framework, and I added functions to the framework by applying contents that are not in the reference materials through Internet search, such as sending e-mail. While working on the project, I solved the obstruction part by looking at the answers and materials left on the community site from the Internet search. However, in the case of RSS, it took a lot of time for this part because it was completely unfamiliar. I also searched for RSS through search and asked my acquaintances while doing external activities, but I couldn't get the answer I wanted because it was unfamiliar. However, I really wanted to solve the questions, so I kept searching and looked it up, and I found that fetching information through RSS was a kind of parsing. After learning that it is a kind of parsing, I looked for materials around the keyword parsing, and found out that there are many libraries for parsing. We found a library suitable for the java environment, selected and decided to use a library called Jsoup, and tested it. In the end, we succeeded in using the Jsoup library to get the information we wanted through RSS and use it in the format we wanted. After importing and processing the information, I used it from the user's point of view, and I found it uncomfortable to see some of the title and content, click on it, and go over to the article page. So I thought it would be effective to implement a paragraph summary algorithm and apply it to the content of the article so that the core content of the article can be understood only by the summary. I decided to implement a paragraph summary algorithm, and I thought about the logic of the algorithm while searching the Internet under the keyword paragraph summary.In the end, the logic of the paragraph summary was implemented so that the key paragraphs could be found by checking the frequency of the words in the article and prioritizing the paragraphs with the words with the highest frequency. Although there were several crises like this, I was able to achieve the desired results by solving them one by one. While working on this project, I could feel that passion and testing from the user's point of view are also important. Although I was unfamiliar with the technology called spring and RSS, I was able to see the earnestness and importance of the project because I focused my passion by looking for and asking questions about the parts that were blocked or incomprehensible during development until it was resolved. When I thought about the parts that I did not know at the time of development from the user's point of view, I was able to find a complement to the paragraph summary, and while developing, I was able to feel that the attitude of developing by considering both sides is important. This project is the result of these two things. As such, I will keep in mind what I felt this time and will not forget it."
"I am a person who is responsible for the results. My father worked abroad for about 10 years from my elementary school to high school. My father worked for a construction company and worked in the Middle East. After entering high school, I started to keep away from studying. Then, while I was video chatting with my father during my second year of high school summer vacation, my father said, ""I trust you. I have been able to work with my family because I believe in you."" He said, ""I will not trust you in the future."" I shed tears. Since then, I have decided to change and actually acted. I thought I should take responsibility for what I am doing. I am a talented person who can communicate with others. I have experience in volunteering at Seongmin Social Welfare Center and Yeongmu Welfare Center, teaching and teaching children of elementary and middle school students. The reason I started volunteering was because I left elementary school in the countryside when I was a child, so I lacked a way to contact better learning. So, I thought of volunteering and volunteering to serve children who are in need at home. The time I spent with children was fun, and I was even more happy if they understood the concept properly. Through volunteer activities, I have grown into a talented person who can increase my self-esteem, look around, and communicate with others. My weakness is that I am too immersed in one task. When I am immersed in one thing, I have a bad habit of holding it until I completely finish it. I had no problem until high school, but when I entered university, I had several assignments, so I needed to adjust my time. As I worked on one task for a long time, I neglected another task, and my overall score eventually decreased. So I set my own standards. I set a time limit for one task. I allocated time according to the importance of the subject, and when the time was limited, I finished the task I was doing once and moved on to the next task. As I have made a habit of controlling time like this, I am no longer busy with assignments. Since then, whatever I do, I set a time and use my time efficiently. With this experience, when dealing with IT tasks in SFA, I will prioritize tasks and efficiently handle tasks with high importance. First of all, I will figure out my work at the beginning of my job and think about how I can incorporate what I learned in the department class and what I learned in external education into my work. In dealing with future work, I will not only study the language but also build experience in business together. In the future, I will try to know more deeply about the field I am in the team than anyone else. In the case of an IT job, when I make a mistake, it is bound to appear immediately. Therefore, I will know the work process I am in charge of in more detail than anyone in the company and think about which part it is more efficient to fix. In addition, I will study so that I can immediately see where it is uncomfortable when a request to modify the computer system comes from the business department that operates the actual work."
"I attended the CES (World Consumer Electronics Show) held in Las Vegas every year as a buyer and was able to experience the best technology in advance. Seeing Samsung occupying the largest booth at the CES, the world's largest electronics exhibition, I was able to feel the status of Samsung in the world. Although it is a different affiliate, I have a dream of becoming an IT person who will lead the future technology at Samsung with the goal of being myself in the world. In addition, I learned about finance through internship at a financial investment company to become a financial IT agent beyond just IT person, and realized that the basic quality of a financial IT person is to provide reliable IT services to customers. I think the most important thing after joining the company is to learn about finance. After grasping the part of my program more accurately than anyone else, I will adapt to the tools I use at the company, quickly learn the necessary qualities in the department, and grow into a convergent professional in IT and finance. From then on, I will not only provide the best financial services, but I will always be humble. I will think of my customers first, thinking that the head office, sales staff, and actual customers who use the programs I made are all my customers. As the head of the IT department of Samsung Futures within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial professional in Korea through Samsung. When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With a combination of English and letters full of the screen, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and developed a vague dream of majoring in computers, and acquired an information processing technician license at the young age of 5th grade in elementary school. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream and just didn't know what to do. At this time, what came to mind was the lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind into practice. First, I sat in the front row serving the professor in the classroom, asked questions actively, participated in the class, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I didn't understand at all gradually caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate assignments and projects by myself. In addition, as I was actively serving not only the professor but also the seniors, I found myself developing my self outside of study. Only then did I understand the lessons of my alma mater, and from then on, it became my values. Since then, if I have a new beginning, I am learning with a low attitude without being proud even if I know the oldest person. I think this is the event that had the greatest impact because it is possible to overcome the difficulties of college and think about the values of my life and in the future. Even after joining Samsung Gift, I will reflect on my values and show you that I am gradually growing by serving seniors and customers from a low attitude."
"My internship at another financial investment company made me interested in financial IT. While studying finance, I learned financial-related knowledge that I had not learned as an IT person, and opened a new world. Among them, I was attracted to the securities industry by having the experience of the securities industry, the flower of the capital market, and the global economy can be encompassed beyond Korea. As a result, I set a new detailed goal of becoming a securities IT person in which the IT knowledge and the securities industry, which I learned in my undergraduate program, are combined. As I was analyzing my work to achieve my goal, I felt that the customers of the financial IT job I supported were not only actual customers but also employees who used my program. I want to provide a computer system for my employees, development and maintenance, and the web and applications for actual customers. I want to grow up to be an IT convergence expert in finance, listening to all customers saying, 'Thanks to IT support, my work has become easier!'. Aiming to become a computer expert, I have prepared two competencies. First, among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important was the basic competency of IT, so I wanted to have a firm domain in the major of computer. Through the undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as Database and C. Java. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy education, I completed education on Web, Java, and DB, and conducted a project called 'Between Musical and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. Second, I tried to provide high quality products through a QA (Qualification Guarantee) intern course of a company called **. Through this, I think we will be able to provide the best quality software from Hyundai Securities. We conducted QA on TrusZone, a network separation solution, and found bugs by conducting Confirm Test and Regression Test through TC for updated items. It was not just looking for bugs, but also modified and managed TC according to the changed contents, tried to develop the product, and recommended it to the staff in charge of changing the program details. In elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With the combination of English and letters full of the screen, I became very curious about the actual program being executed, and the most attractive part was that I could make what I wanted. I was attracted to this and had a vague dream of majoring in computers. After that, I went to college with only a vague dream, but I was just stuck in learning unfamiliar languages and theories. At this time, the word that came to mind was the lesson of my alma mater, 'If you want to grow up, serve others'. I decided to immediately put what came to mind. First, I sat at the front in the classroom, actively asked questions, participated, and served the professor in my heart. As the content that I had no understanding caught my head and eyes, I was able to proceed with undergraduate assignments or projects. As I served not only the professor but also the seniors actively, I found myself developing an ego outside of study. It was only when I understood the lessons of my alma mater, which I had never understood in high school, and from then on, I became my values. After that, I am learning with a low attitude while serving a large person. Even after joining Hyundai Securities, I will reflect on my values and show you how I will develop gradually and become a big person by serving my seniors and customers from a low attitude. It is said that when wolves find the prey they are aiming for, they bite and stretch until the end until they die. So, when I set a goal that I want to achieve with the wolf, I try to keep it patiently. That is why I patiently kept the things I set once. My undergraduate life goal is not to be late or absent, and to complete 100% of the assignment. I lived with the conviction to keep even two basic things. However, when the JAVA final project came out, it was not easy to stay late after staying up all night to complete it. Nevertheless, with my strong mental strength, I had never been late or absent during my undergraduate life, and I also completed 100% of the file-processing final project at that time in addition to the JAVA project. As such, persistence is the driving force behind burning passion. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that I am impatient. In order to compensate for my impatience in my daily life, I often take deep breaths and use a diary to prioritize and practice it. Since the trust given to customers in the financial industry is directly related to the number of customers, we must make ceaseless efforts to build trust. Based on that trust, Hyundai Securities is currently the leading securities company in Korea, but I think we can leap to become the best securities company that provides various high-tech financial services to customers only when we build more trust. In the IT field, we don't give that trust directly. However, I think we can build trust indirectly to people by providing good services such as web pages, mobile devices, and HTS. I want to become an IT employee who indirectly builds trust in Hyundai Securities. After joining the company, I will quickly learn the necessary qualities in the department in charge, such as accurate grasp of the program I am in charge of and acquire financial knowledge, and grow into an IT finance expert to provide services suitable for Hyundai Securities. In addition, by steadily understanding the IT technology trends, we will strive for better IT services by incorporating new technologies into existing IT services. And as the head of Hyundai Securities' IT division within 20 years, I will achieve my dream of becoming the best financial computer in Korea."
"Life is not about living alone. It's about living together. No matter how good each person is, they end up helping each other. I have always wanted to be helpful to others. I also wanted to get help when needed. In college, I prepared for the International Programming Contest (ACM-ICPC) to understand algorithms in addition to studying my major. I participated periodically in the department meeting. We each presented a theme. They said they wanted to do a singing part that they were confident in and helped them understand easily. I also participated in the competition and worked as a group for several hours to solve problems. I worked as a work scholarship student at the IT help desk, an on-campus computer center. I got a call from the finance department and asked to set up my printer. While I was working, I got a call from another department. He said that the PC often stopped because of the blue screen. He asked his colleague to messenger to check the ram short and ask for help to remove dust from the computer fan. After I finished my work, I thanked him and bought him a bottle of drink. We would like to create all kinds of infrastructure for smart school construction in the Middle East and Asia other than Uzbekistan. Since the domestic IT infrastructure market is already saturated, we have to look abroad. In the early days, there was a lack of understanding of human resources and the local situation, but now we have overcome the difficulties. It is time to put more and more development manpower into it. Unlike other companies, LG Ensys has servers from various vendors such as IBM, Oracle, and EMC. I would like to build a system as the main body, not just to be ordered to do it. Through the establishment of a system, I want to contribute to the development of my capabilities in a small way and the growth of the company in a large way. When developing, I always develop it with the customer's details in mind. During the software engineering team project in the second semester of the third year, I developed a restaurant service. In charge of DB, I first created the main menu table after creating the user and operator tables necessary for the login process. I thought about how to allow people to change not only the main menu but also the side menu to suit their taste, and I made an ingredient table according to the menu. In addition, we tried to provide user convenience by creating a history table for order records and displaying a recommended menu. After being discharged from the military, I went to an IT academy while studying in the department. I studied basic knowledge such as C, Java, JSP, and Linux in the network comprehensive class and have experience in building a network virtually using GNS3 and packet tracer. I set up routers and switches, assigned IPs, and then tried static and dynamic routing. It is a virtue that a system engineer should have that there is no restriction on the approach. We developed a remote window control app using Android and Raspberry Pi. The goal was to control two windows individually. In general, the client-server method is a method where there is one server and several clients connect in it. I tried to program it as shown in the book. When I set the settings and pressed the apply button, two windows worked at the same time. After thinking about it for three days, I reversed my thoughts. This was the way multiple servers (Pi) connect to one client (app). During the login process, several ports were connected to one ip using the internetSocketAddress (ip, port) function, and whenever data exchange was needed, the socket was made into a thread and opened and closed, and it was finally solved. Develop it with grit to improve it."
"[Uniforms] I think uniforms with a sense of belonging in group life are words that can express myself. For example, as many students took autonomous classes after entering college, they lived more personal lives than in groups. However, the motivation I made during my college life was to entertain both my seniors and my colleagues. Seeing this, I thought that my friend's interpersonal skills were something to learn from my group life. I also made a commitment to become a person who is necessary and has a presence for people in my group life. First of all, I tried to follow that motivation and learn how to deal with people. Furthermore, in order to meet more people, I joined two Somoim in the computer department and participated actively. Through Somoim's positions, I was able to develop my own communication skills. Through consensus, I learned how to make friends with people I met for the first time, and I recommended expressing my opinions to my passive friends. Over time, I got interesting nicknames like the 'King of Sagan' and the 'King of Inmaek.' Also, I still receive advice from the seniors I made at the university, give counseling to the juniors, and maintain a positive relationship. I am sure that the smooth communication method and interpersonal skills that I have learned will be a member of the KB Data System and show them positively in practice. [Customer-centered IT] What I felt in my college life is that among the many technological fields, the part where people can directly experience technological changes is SW. For example, with the advent of smartphones, the number of telebanking users has decreased and the number of financial services users through smartphone applications has increased. In addition, as I proceeded with the project, I learned that SW can provide convenient services to users with the emergence of new technologies. As such, it allowed me to have customer-centered thinking in college life. KB Data System provides customers with convenience in financial use through banking system, financial institution business system, and financial institution business support system. As such, I think financial IT business is to develop a system that can provide convenience for financial transactions to customers. Also, KB Financial Group is taking on a new challenge of being an Internet-only bank for customers. I think KB Data System, an IT partner of KB Financial Group, will also participate in this challenge. With the customer-oriented thoughts I felt in college life, I wanted to become a new employee who contributes to the growth of the KB Data System, so I applied without hesitation. [Posture after joining the company] I will be a helpful member of the KB Data System. First, after joining the company, I will try to become a true member of the KB Data System. First of all, I will have pride and affection for the company, follow the seniors like shadows, imitate their work skills and attitudes, and make them my own. The reason why the KB Data System was able to come to the current position is that I think it was possible because of the seniors who are now. Second, I will become a member who continues to study to become a recognized SW developer in the KB Data System. This is because I think that major knowledge and work ability for a SW developer is competitiveness. Based on these knowledge, I will actively participate in practical work. Finally, I will have an attitude to conceive about customer-oriented SW without missing new technologies. This is because I think I can provide convenient services to customers through new technologies. In order to lead customer-oriented services, I will pay attention to the emergence of new technologies and come up with a plan for the convergent outcome of financial IT. With this attitude, I will become a new employee '***' who contributes to the growth of the KB Data system. I think teamwork and passion are important factors in practical projects. [Teamwork: FreeRider as a companion] There are students who are free-riding during university group projects. I also have experience facing this situation in a team project at a university. I thought teamwork was important when I was working on a 20** team project, so I held two meetings a week. However, I had a problem in the team meeting, which I thought would be easy. As the meeting progressed, one of the team members began to show an appearance of a freerider who did not perform his or her role. Eventually, there was a setback in the progress of the project, so the rest of the team members, including me, took the role of the freerider instead, and all of them began to complain about the uncooperative attitude. Rather than excluding the team members in this matter, I thought about how I could complete the project together as a team. In order to solve this problem, we decided to have time to communicate with the team members in question. Because I thought that conversation was the only way to solve the heavy team atmosphere. One day, we had a company dinner time and talked about everyday things such as our team members' interests and hobbies. The friend opened his mind and shared his concerns in a comfortable atmosphere. He said that he couldn't understand the contents of the meeting due to the inconvenience caused by the age difference and the lack of technology on the topic he was developing for the first time. It wasn't just this team member's fault that the participation rate decreased. I thought that there were also problems that the team was not interested in the team members. This led me to learn about the importance of communication in the team project. In addition, I had time to communicate with the team members twice a month, and I was able to complete the project within the period through feedback among the team members. In the practical project, I think teamwork among the team members will be more important. Based on this experience, I will contribute my teamwork ability when I proceed with the practical project of KB Data System. [passionate attitude toward goals] In the 20*** Creative Engineering Design course, we have conducted a Smart RC Car project that can express smart cars to come. We developed RC Car remote control and automatic parallel parking functions through a smartphone app. Despite the complete implementation of all the functions, we did not win in the undergraduate contest.I challenged the project once more with the theme of RC Car. This time, computer science students started with the goal of winning the Capstone Design Competition, in which all engineering students in the university participate, not competitors. I came up with an idea for a project that provides driving practice using a car to users in real-world situations, not games, and I started actively recruiting team members to achieve my goal. It was divided into two parts: the video receiving part of a smartphone to be installed in a VR device, and the development of a handle and a pedal that control the RC Car. I was in charge of controlling the direction of the IP Camera using a gyro sensor of the smartphone and the real-time video receiving of the smartphone. The IP Camera control was implemented using four-way buttons mounted on the console handle. In the video streaming part, it was implemented using Thread to provide users with two images to be shown to VR devices in one IP Camera. At the Capstone Design Competition exhibition, I was able to attract the attention of the audience and receive high praise for the judges and creativity. As a result, I won the gold prize at the exhibition and achieved my goal."
"[The beginning and experience of ERP] ** I've been a member of the software membership for nearly a year, and the interview was just around the corner. I've known a few professors since I've been working in the lab, and while I was naturally talking with them before returning to school in the fourth grade, I learned that many public enterprises that use the system and a brief explanation of the ERP system made in SAP are coming to Naju. ERP became very interested in the system after hearing that it is possible to manage the company's resources and support the work efficiently, and I heard that there is a training schedule for specific ERP experts. I quit Samsung Software Membership and started preparing to become an ERP expert in earnest, and thanks to such efforts, I was able to get a job as a computer employee of a company that uses SAP before graduating. I worked there for about a year and seven months, learned development using ABAP language, and experienced maintenance of web pages using BSP and Javascript. In the first year of SCM work, we supported the improvement of the work in the field by developing programs such as reservation of fixed vehicle information management, batch input of orders, batch change of customer information, and upload of dispatch information. We minimized the inconvenience of users through the maintenance of the year-end settlement web page and the labor cost prediction system that improved while working on personnel affairs. The labor cost prediction system requires personnel to predict labor costs for various purposes and times, including annual, quarterly, and monthly, and it has been confirmed that it takes about a week due to numerous variables. The development was successful in reducing the time required for simulation dramatically, and as a result, it showed very successful prediction accuracy. It was a successful task to design and develop a system that had been mentioned about the necessity since the introduction of SAP a long time ago and to meet the needs of users. KEPCO KDN, which is in charge of the IT-related tasks of KEPCO Group, applies electricity IT technology to the entire power system from power generation to customers by selling electricity. We are working to efficiently generate electricity and prevent electricity loss. We are working to build an efficient system by solving problems, and I think KEPCO KDN's role is to contribute to providing high-quality electricity while maintaining low cost. IT moves people and objects and helps them. My passion to become part of KEPCO KDN, the IT conductor of KEPCO Group, which connects people and objects, gave me strong motivation to apply. Also, **PNS' social contribution activities, represented by *****, show the true nature of a company with social responsibility. I believe that social contribution activities to create a better life through the meeting of nature, culture, and mankind will be a link between companies and people, making them a company that can sustainable growth. [We will develop Smart Grid that maximizes efficiency] KEPCO KDN is playing a pioneering role in the field of Smart Grid. In line with that, I will contribute to the development of programs that can help the efficient operation of Smart Grid systems within 5 years or 10 years. For one year, I will strive to become a creative and innovative talent through in-depth consideration of the policies and ideas implemented by the company, and will strive to strengthen teamwork with colleagues. In five years, I will become a professional talent and work hard to develop Smart Grid to identify and supplement the shortcomings based on various experiences. In 10 years, I will become the axis to create Smart Grid that has the characteristics of KEPCO KDN. Smart Grid is KEPCO KDN's business vision to efficiently allocate electricity due to the increase or decrease in electricity usage, to efficiently manage electricity demand, and to prepare for the future in which consumers can become producers. Among them, efficient electricity demand and management will strive to present and develop directions for development by utilizing the experience of improving performance through efficient energy use that I have researched. I will do my best to make the future of the company more special and to establish myself as a leader in the same industry. [Easy road vs. difficult road vs. old method vs. new method] It happened during the military service. I had to manage more than 20 vehicles, including 12 successors who were dispatched to other companies as a driver and a broken car. I was a year apart from my immediate successor, and I was forced to serve as a short squad leader for three months when about half of the cars were unable to move. I was in a situation where I only had to take good care of myself and be discharged from the military because my military life was just around the corner. However, because my successors were struggling in a bad situation, I immediately started to think about whether to choose an easy path for three months as a good older brother or a difficult path to struggle first for the upcoming crisis. The bottom line was that I chose a difficult path for the future. Another problem was the conventional maintenance method. The conventional maintenance method was a natural way for the car owner to manage. However, it did not work properly because there were a lot of vehicles and insufficient personnel, and there were not enough people who knew how to perform the maintenance. I started to approach it in a different way. Regardless of the vehicle owner, I wrote the types that needed to be repaired every day and assigned inexperienced personnel for each type of maintenance. The problem was that it was not my own vehicle maintenance, so when a problem occurred, it could lead to a difficult situation, but I decided to endure that. In the case of receiving accessories, it was difficult for successors to receive them, so they received requests for necessary parts every evening and delivered them to them the next day. Thanks to our hard work, we were able to start all vehicles. We were able to receive a reward leave from the company commander of the dispatch unit. I will become a talented person of KEPCO KDN who creates results in a creative way with a sense of responsibility that is ""us"", not ""me"". [The power of efficiency] What made me interested in ERP was that I did research when I was a university student to increase the efficiency of protocols with limited energy, and I confirmed that there was a breakthrough performance difference.I experienced the power of efficiency to make such a difference under the same conditions, and I was interested to hear that the ERP system is a system that operates the company's resources efficiently. I have a lot of interest and interest in what it would be like to effectively improve the inventory management of products or the flow of products produced, and I have seen the efforts of practitioners to solve this situation from the side and know that it is possible. I will become a talented person who makes continuous efforts to design and develop an efficient system through these direct and indirect experiences. [Prepared ERP Expert] I want to join KEPCO KDN and become a competent ERP expert. In order to become an ERP expert, I obtained SAP ABAP developer certificate and OCP 10G certificate. I also want to be a member of a place that can impress users in the IT field that can identify and meet their needs while impressing them. In addition, I would like to be reborn as an expert who researches and develops directions to develop systems that share and progress tasks in one space into more humane and efficient systems. As a supporting company of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) which is the base business of the Republic of Korea, I have a lot of interest and interest in what it would be like to effectively improve the flow of the entire power system process, production, distribution, and sales process by grasping the characteristics of the power industry. I have seen from the experience of the manufacturer that working-level officials' efforts to solve this situation have been made, and I know that it is possible. I will become a talented person who makes continuous efforts to design and develop an efficient system through these direct and indirect experiences. [Individual ethics is the discipline of the company] KEPCO KDN is in charge of overall IT as it supports KEPCO, which is the base industry of the Republic of Korea. For this reason, KDN is believed to be closely connected to many companies and has a very important symbiotic relationship with a partner who understands the characteristics of the power company. I think that relationships with these characteristics will often have difficulties. The company thinks that it is a place where a lot of talented people gather to do one thing. However, company rules exist because not everyone's thoughts and actions can be the same. All employees of a company must follow the rules of the company. Regardless of the company's personal life, I believe that the most important part of everything is to keep the basics and the foundations, and everything starts with a sense of ethics. Ethical consciousness creates standards for making correct decisions under any circumstances, and it cannot be guaranteed that a person who lacks ethical consciousness follows the company's rules well. KEPCO KDN is a member of Korea's representative group company and has connections with many external companies. As such, many moments of temptation will come to each individual. The fact that each individual's ethical consciousness is not firmly maintained is also related to the company's rules and will lead to the loss of the trust of the Korean people, which will soon be a big problem for the company's future. As a representative company in the country, I think that being better at ethical standards and discipline than anyone else is the basic knowledge of employees in public institutions."
"Due to the influence of my bright and positive parents, I have an open mind that is bright, positive, and respect diversity everywhere. I am open to and accept any possibilities. I am a constant person who continues to challenge myself with the idea that such positive energy affects others around me and that I can do it even in difficult situations. Also, I consider relationships to be the most important thing in society, so I treat people with respect and consideration. Therefore, I have a good relationship and am responsible for everything given to me and finish meticulously. In order to make up for the slow work due to my meticulous personality, I can find my own know-how and process things accurately and quickly. The biggest weakness is not having much knowledge or experience in security, but I am confident that I can do well if I am interested and try my best as everyone does. In addition, through the enjoyment and teamwork that I value in Com2uS, I believe that I can be a multi-playable talent who can perform given tasks and furthermore, help me grow steadily, so I will continue to challenge and learn as much as possible. As I learned programming in college, I dreamed of becoming a developer. In particular, I am interested in security, and recently, I am studying theoretical while preparing for an information security driver certificate. Although I have no experience in security practice yet, I applied for game security because I thought there was a possibility of growth by constantly studying and challenging without giving up because it is a career path I wanted to challenge. In addition, I think it is a company that can lead me to demonstrate my best ability to develop and work happily with my team members by emphasizing teamwork, and above all, I applied for Com2uS because it is located in a short distance, making it easier to leave and leave work and perform work efficiently. Although not in the game security field, I have experience in coding c and c++ using visual study, and I have experience in Windows phones and mfc. In addition, I have experience of learning java, experience of making sos application with Android studio, and have experience in developing various languages and tools such as HTML and my sql. First of all, I will try to adapt quickly to the team that belongs to Com2uS, focus on work training for practical purposes, and review them repeatedly so that I can perform the given task smoothly. I will study security-related knowledge, acquire related certificates, realize that I am lacking in work, and continue to learn in an attitude of learning. In order to improve my practical skills as well as intellectual aspects, I will ask a lot of advice from my colleagues and constantly challenge myself to solve them. Also, as a global company, I will continue to prepare for studying English, foreign languages such as Chinese and Japanese, and I will develop the capabilities of global talents so that overseas work can proceed smoothly. I will continue to develop and change from an employee who can always enjoy games with a bright and positive mind, and I will also work with pleasant people at a pleasant Com2uS and create a Com2uS that extends around the world with tremendous synergy."
"""I will grow into a core talent with my strengths of consistency and communication skills."" TmaxTibero is the best database company in Korea, reflecting differentiated architecture and various functions. In addition, it succeeded in developing TAC (DB Clust Technology), which Oracle has monopolized, for the second time in the world. It is recording a steady growth rate of over 10% every year in the domestic market. In the future, development of software is important, but I think continuous management and operation through software QA service are more important. In this regard, I think the ability to communicate with customers is important. I applied to TmaxTibero because I thought I could show my strengths of consistency and communication skills well. In the short term after joining the company, I will try to strengthen my major knowledge into practical conversations, acquire knowledge and information necessary for practical use, and adapt to my work. I will act as a mid-point in managing new employees in the medium term. Based on the experiences and difficulties I experienced when I was a new employee, I will help new employees to adapt quickly to their work. In the long term, I have expertise in QA job. As such, I feel responsible for my duties, and I will thoroughly verify DBMS products, minimize bugs, and guide customers in advance about possible problems, thereby minimizing issues and making DBMS satisfied. My strength is that I never give up even though it's hard for the first time. After eight years of patiently working out at the gym more than five days a week, my body, which was nicknamed 'OO' with a small body weighing 175cm and 55kg, has been able to change into a 75kg muscle-like body. As a high school student, I was not confident due to my small body, so I recklessly started doing push-ups to change my appearance and increase my confidence. No matter how annoying and physically difficult I was, I steadily did 100 times a day for at least five days a week. After joining the military, I continued to exercise and gained strong enough physical strength to acquire a top-class warrior. After being discharged from the military, I made plans by watching exercise videos on YouTube and started working out in three parts. From the M-sized t-shirt I used to wear in high school, I now wear size XXL. I was able to realize once again the importance of the results accumulated by consistently doing seemingly trivial things every day. The downside is that I tend to be nervous in front of people. When I go on stage for an important presentation or a hall serving part-time, I get nervous, so I often can't show as much result as I've prepared. To compensate for these shortcomings, I gave presentations when doing group assignments and actively gained presentation experience in front of many students I've never seen before. Through these experiences, I was able to overcome more tension in front of the public than in the past. As for my expertise in the field of recruitment, I learned various programming languages such as C, JAVA, and PYTHON by majoring in in in information and communication engineering during my undergraduate days. In order to learn scarce knowledge such as software design, development, and maintenance, I obtained an information processing engineer license. In addition, after working at an event and a hall serving part-time for three years, when customers did not like them or suffered damage due to store negligence, I tried to provide the best service possible while communicating with customers, and my communication skills improved. In the future, I will continue to reduce tension through a lot of presentation experience and various activities with my strength of consistency. In addition, I will continue to study the knowledge and information necessary for quality control to increase my professionalism, communicate with various people, and improve my communication skills to become a talented person who grows up. ""If you do nothing, nothing happens, but if you challenge something, there is always a change."" After working as a serving part-timer at a sushi restaurant for three years, the monthly sales usually ranged from 1 million won to 2 million won on average on Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. On Fridays and Saturdays, it cost about 2 million won to 3 million won. However, due to COVID-19, the store's sales have been cut in half due to restrictions on the number of people and hours. The restaurants I worked in were mostly sold in halls, and deliveries averaged about five a day. When I thought about it to increase sales, I found that many students lived alone around the school. If I ordered delivery, it was too much to eat alone. I suggested to the boss that we add a single person menu to the delivery menu and add more basic side dishes that we go out together. In the case of basic side dishes, they suggested adding white kimchi, salt bridge, and ssamjang that customers visit when they visit the store, and providing two fried shrimp that customers say is delicious as a review event. In this way, we added a menu for one person, basic side dishes, and review events. As time passed, about 5 to 10 deliveries usually came in, but as 30 to 40 on weekdays and about 60 came in on weekends, it became similar to sales before COVID-19. Although net profit decreased compared to before COVID-19 due to delivery costs and ingredient prices due to additional basic side dishes and review events, sales were similar. I think sales will increase further if COVID-19 eases over time. For the Capstone design competition ""Based on cooperation and responsibility,"" we developed an attendance check program through face recognition. The reason for the development of the program is that as non-face-to-face classes are held due to COVID-19, professors and classmates feel difficult to check attendance and plan to develop it for classmates who have difficulty checking attendance properly. The program was developed by two people including me. When developing the program, I was in charge of server development and membership information registration. The team member wrote a code that compares the existing registered face with the face to be checked for attendance, and a code that sets environmental variables and detects faces. The rest of the facial recognition development was done with the team member. Our team had no experience with open cv and python, so we started to learn how faces are recognized by searching YouTube and Naver about facial recognition. When we found materials related to face recognition, we shared them and explained what we knew and didn't know.The server development was developed by using REST API method to separate the server from the local, compare it with the picture stored on the server, and if it matches, attendance verification was processed. The membership information registration was developed so that if you enter the subject and name you are taking and register a picture of your face, you can be saved in a file. The face recognition part is a program that uses open-source facenet-pytorch to be present if it matches the picture stored in the file. Since it was our first time doing this field, we were able to complete the program because we felt responsible for our duties while teaching each other what we didn't know. Even though we did not win the prize, it was a good opportunity to encounter various fields while making the program."
"I am 00th year JAVA developer 000. The back end uses Java, Spring Framework, Mybatis, and the front end uses JSP. DB uses Oracle, mysql, to develop the web, check servers, and maintain solutions. Participating in the 2nd authentication development project of OO customer, we received the 2nd authentication RESTful API design and the customer's requests, and completed the 2nd authentication development by reflecting them in the future development direction. A team of two participated as the main developer in the OO customer's system reconstruction project, designed RESTful API, distributed apps to Linux servers, and monitored services, and built and opened the system stably. As a lot of news is reported every day and fake news is being sold, there are many cases of wearing colored glasses even if it is a breaking news. Perhaps because of the increase in people like me, sites for fact-checking have begun to appear, and it would be nice if there was a service that indicates news that has been confirmed in JTBC news. For example, if a check icon indicating that you are an authenticated user on YouTube is displayed next to the ID, a check mark is placed in front of the news title to let the user know that the news is confirmed, so that users can trust the news and make JTBC more competitive by providing services differentiated from other media companies through the service"
"""Life as a computer soldier with my parents"" They have always served as guides and mentors for my life. My father, who has pride in his career, has emphasized an attitude to do his best in everything. My father's teaching allowed me to pay close attention to even the smallest things and make efforts. It influenced the formation of my values, ""Those who work hard are not allowed to do anything."" In addition, my mother, who supported me by saying, ""Can you do it until the end?"" She has developed perseverance not to give up on her task in the middle. Also, it was during the period when I worked as a computer soldier of the OO Division that I was able to change and build values in my life. Resolving network disruptions in the division was my mission and network was at the core of my military's work, so resolving them required considerable responsibility and meticulousness. Even if I was in a technical position, I was a computer soldier who worked for executives, so I could feel the importance of friendly service spirit and accurate information delivery. And it was important to be honest about what was unresolved. I've seen cases where lying because I'm afraid of being scolded can make the problem serious, so I've learned that it's important to be honest and get help from others. ""Ruling memory by record"" meticulousness. The best thing about being organized is the habit of integrating and managing notes and notes in an electronic notebook. There's a saying that goes ""record governs memory."" I think it's a really good habit to keep records of group meetings, ideas, learning, areas of interest, and everything. Using electronic notebooks, I could quickly take notes anytime, anywhere, and search for words I wanted to use the Ctrl+F key to find them all quickly and organically. If you keep doing what you can, you can't do what anyone can. This habit of organizing and trying to systematically manage the incoming knowledge will be the best help in your work. I had taken an English presentation class when I was in fourth grade. I hated the personality of not being able to speak well in front of people, so I took the class to practice English presentation in front of people before moving on to society. I also messed it up because I was nervous at the first presentation. After class, the professor said that I was originally more nervous than I was, and that practice is the only way to live. I started practicing in front of the mirror as I learned from the professor, and I was speechless imagining myself standing in front of people, but I kept practicing until the tension subsided. After practicing several times, I was able to successfully finish the final presentation and the evaluation table that the professor gave me with a smile marked perfect scores for everything. Like this experience of overcoming shortcomings, I have been living with a top priority on my growing life and am aiming for the following life. The first is a life in which I am harmonized with people. Just as meeting the professor led me in a better direction, I was able to grow in a good direction thanks to the people around me, and I think that I exist in the present. The second is a life of challenge. In order to grow, I need opportunities such as ""presentation classes,"" so I have tried to use them as a springboard for my leap forward by challenging various internal and external activities. ""Think of what to do today."" The most important thing to do every day is to wake up early in the morning and think of what to do today in advance. I can wake up early and put myself together by thinking about my daily routine. This may be trivial, but after doing the first simple task that I had planned in the morning, I felt a small sense of pride and satisfaction, giving me the courage to do the next task. After the day ended as I had planned, I was able to continue working on the next day and the next day. However, waking up early in the morning and thinking about my daily schedule is very cumbersome. If I didn't do it a day or two, it was difficult to achieve a full day and it was easy to break up until the next day. I thought that if I couldn't do such a trivial thing, I couldn't do better, so I tried to stay defiant and steady, and now I have become a habit. Even after joining OOO, the courage and satisfaction of waking up early in the morning to complete each of the tasks that I had planned will greatly help me to unleash my passion, activism, and creativity. It was time for OOO to do a team project. Our theme was 'Choosing the Best Location of a Charging Station for Hydrogen Cars.' I was making it easy to do research and find papers and data related to Hydrogen Cars, but I found an unexpected problem. Even if the location was selected in consideration of the floating population or the area where a lot of hydrogen cars were purchased, it was difficult to select the optimal location in the Seoul area because of the perception that hydrogen charging stations were hateful facilities and the safety distance from legally designated shelters. Inevitably, we were able to find the optimal location by converting an LPG charging station that had already met the safety conditions similar to a hydrogen charging station to a hydrogen charging station. If we had done this more accurately in advance, the analysis could have been done more accurately without wasting time. Although it was not solved effectively due to public awareness and safety factors, it was an experience that I could learn the importance of accurate analysis of problems at the beginning of the project. This is when I had an internship experience at an IT infrastructure company. As I was working with my colleagues on the task of installing the APM source and linking the XE with the APM source, problems occurred depending on the version. The solution to the problem depending on the version is complicated and requires an understanding of each function. A good way to solve the problem in a situation where the amount of knowledge is large and the amount of time is low, and the ability to collect information and manage the collected information systematically. I have a habit of systematically managing knowledge such as school classes and search contents by using online notes, which are usually electronic notebooks, but when I needed to know a large amount of information, electronic notebooks helped me a lot. This method helped me a lot when I was an intern. Even now, electronic notes that are systematically organized to check what I learned or materials at that time are very helpful.I entered the Department of Information and Communication Engineering, admiring the sparkling server room ""the first step toward my dream,"" but the first grade class did not have any subjects dealing with equipment that I had expected. Thus, I attended a computer academy and set a goal of becoming a computer soldier in the military in order to directly operate the network and server equipment. I studied my major fields such as network and Linux Windows in advance, and as a result, I passed the CCNA exam and applied for the computer soldier. I joined the military as a computer soldier with the goal of ""21 months of IDC life, where I was able to learn values, service spirit, and professionalism"", and I worked on network management and composition of the entire division in the 00th Division. Since network was the core of military work, resolution of disability required considerable responsibility, and since I was a computer soldier working against executives, I was able to learn the service spirit better than anyone else. Even in a technical position, I could feel with my body that it was important to deliver kind and accurate information because I had to deal with people. And it was important to be honest about what was not solved. I've seen cases where lying because I'm afraid of being scolded can make the problem serious, so I've learned that it's important to be honest and get help from colleagues. It's very important to give trust through responsibility, honesty, service spirit, and expertise in dealing with your IT infrastructure. More than anyone else in two years, these experiences have helped me learn the importance of professionalism, reliability, and customer satisfaction. ""Thinking about the value of interns and engineers"" In the military, if it was focused on network, I took training in the overall infrastructure and server field while doing internship. During the two months of internship training, I received basic Linux & Aix training, VMware, X86 server, Ansible, and storage, and for a month, I attended the training. During the training period, I visited various customer IDC and worked on basic tasks such as rack installation, server mount OS default setting, raid configuration, and dualized testing, and I tried to understand the overall flow of infrastructure by looking at the plans and network configuration diagram. In addition, I thought about where to place the value of infrastructure engineers in a situation where infrastructure is becoming clouded and virtualized. I believe that these experiences and capabilities will help you adapt to GS Neotech's cloud technology support department. I will join GS Neotech and become an employee who can give customers confidence based on my experience and expertise in infrastructure through experience in military computer soldiers and internship in IT infrastructure, which are the basic tasks of engineers."
"1) BE development 2) FE development 3) Android development computer vision / A+ / It was a useful class to learn and practice various image processing functions required for actual image processing. I was able to learn analysis techniques through data preprocessing or visualization techniques necessary for data visualization / A+ / Deep learning. I was able to learn basic concepts such as clustering and PCA, which are pattern recognition techniques based on pattern recognition / A+ / Unsupervised learning. Algorithm analysis / A+ / Programmers were able to have a solid foundation of the basics such as alignment algorithms, BFS and DFS search methods. I was able to organize the theoretical concepts for optimization problem research / A+ / Machine learning Optimization, and I was able to learn techniques for weight reduction. Starting with the history of machine learning and deep learning / A / Deep learning, it helped me understand the overall concepts such as CNN and RNN. I participated in NAVER AI RUSH 2020, which competes for ranking by putting a deep learning model on the real-time ranking board to increase AI modeling ability. I experienced the problem of the Imperfect database for the first time by challenging the automatic classification section of the Naver shopping review image in the second round. Although the given dataset was mixed with imbalance labels and noise, it was only accessible algorithmically because it was given in a form of not being able to directly access the data. To solve this problem, we collected papers on the Balance dataset and Noise robustness and Bag of traces data and applied them step by step. Due to the imbalance, the insufficient ratio of the dataset was filled with augmentation data using oversampling, and generalization of noise data was suppressed by the calculation of the label smoothing loss. When applying this technique, it was confirmed that it increased from the first F1-score 0.46 to 0.67. However, although it has undergone several parameter tuning since then, the performance has not improved anymore, and we have faced difficulties. Meanwhile, we planned to apply a noise refinement method that performs Pseudo labeling only data exceeding a certain confidence score using self-training. Using the model of F1-score 0.67 as the Teacher model, we generated a better Student model with the refined dataset, and we repeated the cyclic structure of refining the data with the generated Student model as the Teacher again. We were able to get the effect of increasing the F1-score to 0.81. After that, we learned the models of several network structures using refined data labels and raised the performance with Ensemble to create the final model of F1-score 0.879. We won second place in the ""Results"" competition. I thought that I was able to solve the problem and reach the high ranking because I really enjoyed and immersed myself in it. Through cause analysis and systematic implementation, we learned the approach to solving the problem of the Imperfect dataset and it became a valuable experience to grow further by faithfully learning the basic knowledge of image classification. After the ""What's Too Much"" competition, I looked up materials and seminars on model performance improvement and learned that K-fold cross-validation, image mixup augmentation, and small batch size are more advantageous in generalization because they are taught in flat shapes. It is a simple technique that can be easily applied, but it was regrettable that it was not applied at the time of the competition. If I enter a similar competition again, I decided to show my improved skills with the goal of winning the first place."
"While working as corporate supporters, I was in charge of the planning department in a product planning project suitable for the local commercial district and held a meeting. Based on the target group and purpose of the product, a report that synthesizes the effective product and expected effects had to be submitted within a week. I thought it was best to accept and respect the stories of all the team members and produce satisfactory results for everyone. However, I found that this open attitude was not effective when it came to meetings. It is because the efficiency of time has been too low for everyone to agree. First of all, we emphasized that there is a common goal of planning the most effective product within the local commercial district, and changed it to prioritize and make up for the shortcomings through mutual consultation. Thanks to the attitude of accepting the other person's opinion, I was able to actively communicate with people, but I realize that it is not a good thing to be unconditionally tailored to others, so I am working hard to assert myself little by little. I worked as a hall management manager at a fast food restaurant two years ago. Located next to the theater, there were an average of 10 minutes a day of customers complaining that the waiting time for the movie to start was long. Both customers and employees were struggling with repeated complaints, so I thought about ways to improve customer satisfaction and store image. Through a book related to customer psychology, I learned that when customers feel that they have waited longer than they thought or when they cannot guess how long they should wait, they feel that the waiting time is long psychologically. So, I told the manager and bought several stopwatches. We provided a stopwatch with waiting times entered upon payment. As a result, the number of customers complaining about waiting time decreased from an average of 10 to 5 per day, as well as the number of complaints about waiting time decreased from 10 to 5 per day, and the number of complaints related to service was reduced compared to the previous one. I will work in a positive attitude with a sense of responsibility, thinking that even the slightest opinion can be of great help. I conducted a simulation of management during my college class. Our team's goal was to win first place with the most investment. We only divided opinions that were not organized because we wanted to achieve good results in a short period of time. So, I started organizing the tasks one by one to achieve our goals. First of all, I divided into the planning department and the public relations department. The meeting was allowed to be held by each department, and then the integrated meeting was held. The meeting, which was filled with only various opinions, became more specific and completed, and had a direction. Also, everyone was able to work in their respective roles. As a result, I was able to win the overall title, which was my goal. This gave me an opportunity to feel that good results will naturally follow if I let go of my impatience and go through the tasks in front of me one by one. I think the most necessary skill for this task is to classify data according to each standard based on the use of computers. I have been gaining computer-related certificates for a long time and have endeavored to acquire related knowledge and utilization skills to develop data collection and processing capabilities. I applied for related classes during the semester and built up basic knowledge, and during vacation, I developed analysis, interpretation, and practical skills based on big data analysis education and industry data education. In addition, while working part-time at a restaurant and classifying food materials according to the list, I personally realized the importance of classifying and registering them according to the standards. Based on the importance felt through experience, I will handle the task of organizing and registering a list of public data within the institution with a sense of responsibility. Based on our ability to use computers, we will actively and sincerely carry out training for performing tasks so that we can help you perform real tasks."
"Looking at ""Zeus"" and ""Tibero"" SW, which made Tmax possible today, I felt that it was one of the few companies that knew the importance of securing original technology, and I applied because I was convinced that I was a company that could work for the rest of my life by receiving the news that spared no effort to invest about 1 trillion won in technology to make another leap. I think it is the basis for supporting this that decades have passed, it has affected Korea's No. 1 middleware sector, Korea's best DBMS system, and even leading large companies and overseas public institutions. Based on the ability to prepare for a technology start-up based on the knowledge I have studied while working as an assistant researcher at the lab for more than a year, I have an ambition to use Tmax's technology to find a new industry group and create another opportunity to make a big leap with my own hands by doing business, consulting, and business planning that directly affects the company's sales. My biggest advantage is that I have a history of preparing for a start-up, so I have a quick understanding of technology and am passionate in persuading and understanding others. In order to develop various capabilities as a worker in the future, I have always taken internal and external education centered on SW as well as mechanical engineering, and based on this, I felt a sense of accomplishment through challenges such as registering bio-technical papers, participating in a competition for financial phenomena, preparing for start-ups, and completing AI education. The downside is that I am active and passionate, so I have a strong desire to win. When not only I but also my people and my team are broken, I stay up all night to make up for the shortcomings or to supplement the shortcomings of logic or materials and dig in until the other party is persuaded. By harmonizing these advantages and disadvantages, I have received the Bronze Award from the Director of Defense Acquisition Program Administration at a startup competition hosted by the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, which proposes a business model by utilizing the convergence and connection of technology and technology, which is the core of the fourth industry. In particular, my business item is an ICT wearable device that utilizes future technologies that represent creation and challenges, and was developed to prevent ""sickness"" accidents, which are three major safety accidents in the private sector, along with crashes and crashes. The biggest difference from the current suffocation prevention device in the market is that it is a ""system"" in which internal workers wear a ""wearable"" device and ""simultaneously"" measure the concentration of bio-signals and harmful gases in real time, and send them to external workers. As it was not just an idea competition, but a startup competition, I focused my efforts on writing a business plan and building a business model. I wanted to create an item that I had always pursued to pursue a safe and shared world, so I set the concept as an item that realizes the public values of safety accident prevention from the beginning of the design. The B2G model was laid as the base, and the business areas of the country market were specified by referring to OOO's 2019 business report. In addition, while taking the training organized by OOO and OOO, I learned how to read business trends and theories that can be really sold in the marketplace that customers want. The results were good, but it was also the most challenging and difficult thing in my life. I formed a team with three people and took on the role of the team leader, and the rest were students in the electronics department and the junior colleagues in the medical engineering lab, who I learned through participation in lab assignments. As such a diverse group of people formed a team, there was no choice but to have disagreements. Instead of listening to the needs of my team members, I resolved the conflict by giving them other relatively easy tasks. To my greed, I wanted to apply deep learning technology to the measured data and even apply a technology that minimizes errors to the prototype. However, as a result of the discussion, I agreed that the team members of the electronic engineering department were less attractive to appeal to the judges compared to the efforts they made in the technology, and included it only in the future business plan. Instead of taking a step back from the application of deep learning technology, I assigned the student an additional task related to the communication technology that I was most confident in. For communication in confined spaces, I participated in a meeting with a contest mentor to listen to technical advice on research on how to apply military tactical communication. Through communication, I solved the problem in the direction of moving forward to the common goal by appropriately assigning different tasks when there was a conflict, and I was able to win the prize with a good result of being sixth out of 151 teams."
"I applied because I wanted to contribute to CJ Olive Networks' top tier-level life culture digital service provision business. While majoring in computer engineering, my ultimate goal became to deliver value to customers through new technologies. Looking at Olive Networks' ""Factory One,"" I felt that it was a solution that combines the latest technologies, such as accurately grasping customer needs that fit the trend, applying ""blockchain"" to secure information and providing solutions using ""artificial intelligence."" I want to work with Olive Networks, which creates value by satisfying the needs of users with these innovative technologies. In addition, I applied for the job because I wanted to apply the web development capabilities I had accumulated in my undergraduate years to such value creation. I will always grow with a learning attitude and communicate to become CJ's Only One developer. To do this, I have three capabilities. First, I developed analytical thinking and problem solving skills by taking on the backend role in project development. I have experience in developing APIs using Springboot and distributing them through AWS. I solved the development problem through debugging and analyzed the situation to solve the error in the distribution process. This will be helpful in providing more convenient and safe services to CJ Olive Networks' customers. Second, we constantly challenge ourselves to accept and apply new technologies. In the graduation project, we developed a depression test web service based on SNS data and machine learning. We conducted research to increase the accuracy and published it as a thesis. Based on these capabilities, we will strive to combine CJ One Data with new technologies, and we will contribute to the development of innovative CJ services based on this. Third, we are good at collaborating and communicating. During my internship, I had experience in collaborating with planners and designers and renewing actual services. At that time, I was short on time due to a short internship period, but I suggested it to other team members to make a systematic plan and explained the development language so that other team members could understand it easily. As a result, I was able to successfully complete the renewal within the internship period. I would like to introduce CJ's own service by pioneering and developing new fields through differentiated analysis and understanding of customers. With the advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution, new technologies are pouring out from 6G predictions beyond 5G to artificial intelligence and IoT. Using these technologies, I think we need to understand various customer companies such as Korea Express, CheilJedang, and CJ ENM and develop advanced services accordingly. Therefore, I will achieve this goal by becoming a developer who internalizes the understanding and analysis of technology and customers for the development of CJ's best service. To this end, I will make the following efforts. First, I will understand CJ Olive Networks and its team members. Development at CJ Olive Networks is not about being alone, but a combination of cooperation with team members who are outstanding in each field and CJ Olive Networks' know-how. What is important in the system development work is that it contributes to the achievement of the company's challenging goals, but I think you are a true expert only when you can overcome work problems with your team members. Rather than thinking only about my position, I will always think about my colleagues' position and become a team member who I want to work with. Also, I will think about why these goals are necessary for the company's work and try to understand the business by engraving the words and goals of CJ Olive Networks CEO. Second, I will strengthen my technology. The IT development job I applied for continues to come out with the latest technologies and demands a lot of expertise. Therefore, I will constantly pursue interest in new technologies, accept new technologies, and develop them through the in-house talent education system. I will think about how to strengthen my technology and apply them to the service more innovatively and conveniently. Finally, I will understand the customers. I will understand the customers by analyzing them with interest in their processes and environment. In addition, I will not let go of my interest in the trend and study the customized services of the customers that fit the flow. Based on this, I will truly identify the needs of the customers and develop innovative services."
"""Next generation security leader who strives steadily"" I did a lot of activities related to my application job. In particular, I focused a lot on information security. When new items came out, I always wondered and studied what was different from the existing ones. Coding is also necessary for analysis of vulnerable source codes based on white boxes, so I had to learn various languages such as C.C ++, Python, and assembly. As a result, I was able to achieve good grades in a number of programming subjects, and in the case of security, it was very helpful to know how to attack them to secure them. In order to understand more detail, I created a virtual environment and practiced attack. I joined the hacking/security club on campus, studied the club, presented seminars, and learned more about the technical aspects. As a reporter for the college student at a related company, I was able to encounter a lot of things that were happening in the information security field since I was in the lower grade. In the case of the military, I was assigned to the information protection soldier and operated equipment such as NAC, UTM, and vaccine server to manage nodes and PCs under the corps. After that, while working on the IT project, I was able to analyze the weaknesses of IoT equipment and digital signage using Bluetooth with my mentor. In the case of the project, I was able to receive bugbounties and letters of appreciation in recognition of the achievements of the project. In addition, I received the Outstanding Papers Award at the Korea OOO Association Winter Conference by writing a paper on how to trigger related vulnerabilities and the Outstanding Papers Award for undergraduate students at the Korea OOO Association. With the skills gained from these experiences, I went to the contest titled 'Find OOO Security Holes' hosted by the Korea OOO Corporation and won the top prize. ""A lot of experience makes me competent."" By doing many activities related to the job, I was able to gain job experience and at the same time develop my collaboration and communication skills. Information security, which is my major field, has experienced everything from management to analysis to office work. I think there may be experiences that are necessary and not necessary for performing a job. Since I have little experience in communication, I only have no experience using equipment such as routers, switches, and UPS, and job training is required for other equipment. However, I am passionate and confident that I can perform any task. If I join the Incheon Transportation Corporation, I will try to learn how to use the equipment quickly based on my experience and become familiar with the work so that I can faithfully complete my work. In this era of increasing wireless communication, Haneum's wireless security project will also be helpful in building or operating facilities. ""Passion, Becoming the Driver of Dreams."" I am a passionate person. Since I was young, I had a hobby of disassembling and fixing electronic devices myself when they broke down. Sometimes I got hurt, but when something was fixed, I felt good and was interested in solving the problem. Then one day, my computer at home broke down and I tried to fix it, but I failed. Then, a relative who was a computer science student came home and disassembled the computer to fix it, and at that time, I was fascinated by complex and simple computers. That's how I went to a related department. After going to school, I studied information protection and thought it was difficult but fun, and I was able to participate in hacking/security clubs on campus, present studies and seminars, and practice technical aspects. The military also applied as a computer soldier, and I received an information security soldier in my own university and served. By managing the PCs and servers under the Corps, I was able to learn more about the importance of information protection, and I prepared/audited various security audits to enhance my understanding of security settings. I think the basics of communication are operational capabilities and security. I think I have an experience that is suitable for this. ""Improving Security"" There are more embedded devices than in the past, and there are many situations where the Internet is connected. Security will be important if smart cities are developed in the future and V2M networks become practical. Accordingly, I think Incheon Transportation Corporation should check the security trend of the latest technology and refer to it when building new technologies. Connection is important, but sustainability is also important, so investment and talent training are necessary for sustainable security. Accordingly, before Incheon Transportation Corporation steps forward and applies a new technology, it should conduct a vulnerability analysis and take an agile work format to supplement it. Security will improve over time if problems are discovered periodically and continuously supplemented. While working on the ""strong when together"" vulnerability analysis project, each team member has a different progress schedule and method, so I had a hard time coordinating disagreements about the project schedule. Each team member had a preferred method of progress. Through conversation, the team member's experiences, strengths, and weaknesses were identified, and the work efficiency was increased by dividing the task to achieve the purpose of the project earlier than expected. Therefore, I believe that when living in a community, I should have colleagues around me, rather than someone who is indispensable. Everyone takes it for granted that they always have a colleague next to them. Some colleagues' work seems to be more rested than I am. However, if I try to do that person's work instead of me, I feel that the work that seems to be resting was more difficult than I thought. I think that the person in charge of anything should recognize and respect its value because they are experts. ""Looking at it from a different perspective"" I once participated in a competition called ""Find OOO Security Loopholes"" hosted by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority. It was conducted in the form of receiving points when finding vulnerabilities on the homepage, and the scoreboard was shared in real time, so it was a system that allowed us to know how many points our team had earned and what the ranking was. There was time left, but there were no more vulnerabilities, so only time was passing. Our team, which wanted to be in the top rankings, needed some points.I was wondering if there was a good way, but I found new sites by changing the language of the same homepage that other teams had not tried. As a result, I was able to find pages that I had not found before and had the experience of analyzing vulnerabilities. As a result, I performed well and won the grand prize. ""Security Regulations that do not know internal circumstances."" When I was in the military, I worked in the information protection class. In the case of information protection equipment, there is a password management ledger, and a related work manager was required to see the password management ledger. However, related workmen had to commute to work and the information protection system should have been operated 24 hours a day. The soldiers working here had to call the executive when changing or browsing the password, which they thought was a waste of time that was quite unnecessary. The upper-level unit at the headquarters level had a 24-hour rotation, but the lower-level unit was not able to work 24 hours a day due to insufficient personnel. I discussed this with the platoon leader, and I exercised my discretion to the extent that the regulations were followed, granting the relevant authority to the seniors at the squad leader level. As a result, soldiers are less likely to call in executives even if they work 24 hours a day, and executives are also less likely to visit. ""The company that develops because of me"" I am a student who is very interested in in information protection. While seriously considering my senior year in high school, I learned about information protection, went to the university's department of information protection, received several academic scholarships, and worked in the military as an information security guard. However, up until this point, my weakness was that I lacked perseverance compared to the passion I wanted to do. However, I came to learn persistence by meeting good executives in the military. As a result, I was able to win first place for the first time since the establishment of the unit at the squad leader training center on Onda. Before I left the military, I had always studied various fields only through superficial education, but after I was discharged from the military, I thought that I should do it one by one properly, so I am continuing to challenge myself with persistence. The fact that I am fulfilling my goal until I achieve it was thought that the milestone toward the global future that Incheon Transportation Corporation aims for was a good match for me, so I applied. I have studied information protection for a long time and I think I have the potential to develop further. I will develop and develop this potential with the seniors who are working."
"My motivation for applying to the National Information Society Agency was to help me learn professionally about building big data platforms and networks. Establish policies and activation plans related to the creation of a data ecosystem for the revitalization of intelligent information technology such as big data and artificial intelligence, collect various data, processing and empirical analysis of statistical data, collecting and comparing and analyzing data related to social phenomena and policy trends, preparing reports through big data analysis, data mining, machine learning, planning and strategies to produce and build data, establishing plans and strategies to revitalize distribution and transactions, business management on big data platforms and network construction projects, and I would like to participate in the establishment of policies and activation plans related to the creation of an ecosystem for the revitalization of intelligent information technology such as big data and artificial intelligence. By gaining experience and skills through hands-on experience, I will acquire big data and artificial intelligence technology, one of the technologies of the 4th industrial revolution, which will serve as the basis for revitalizing the big data platform and network construction business of the National Information Society Agency. I have been working in SI for about three years at a venture company and automating manufacturing plants for about four years. Although the field was different from the IT business of the National Information Society Agency, I worked as the basis for the smart factory business in the manufacturing plant automation field. While developing the company's software, such as developing industrial board-related software and developing embedded WinCE in venture companies, I participated in production-related system development projects such as MES and MCS, which are factory automation solutions. The technology in venture companies was only a developer's specifications. When I first encountered manufacturing automation, I had difficulty attending meetings with manufacturing equipment engineers, solving problems occurring in manufacturing equipment, checking requirements for issues that would become an issue, and working together on actual development jobs were difficult. However, after several equipment meetings and meetings, I got used to the work, making it easier to meet more than seven equipment, and I gained confidence in the work. Later, I also communicated with female Japanese engineers. When I was in college, I was asked by my friend to be the deputy director of the Propaganda and Planning Department of the Natural University Student Association. It was a position where it was difficult to create a member of my subordinate department because the work of the Propaganda and Planning Department was more laborious than other departments. The student council president and I were in charge of the propaganda planning department, but since it was our first time meeting it, the organization called the student council was unfamiliar, and I wanted to quit as well because I was unfamiliar with the work done by the student council. I cried a lot, and I was under the pressure of doing it alone, so I didn't know what to do. I learned the work of the planning department one by one with the help of my friends and the student council president whenever that happened. I had to make my own PC for the campus, make a handwritten poster, plan student council events, inform my classmates of the event at the festival, and there were many small chores. The student council president and I were unfamiliar with the work even though the members of the propaganda planning department who came in late said that it was delayed, but my friends said that it was surprising to see me working in an organization called the Natural University Student Council. Words like gentle, moral example, and conscientious attitude come to mind as the most important virtues for employees working in public institutions. I believe that working in a public institution, you should be gentle without being overly involved in corruption or corruption, and that you should be a moral example for other people's requests for personnel management. So, I think that being honest with my work, working with a sense of mission and expertise in my job, and working with the National Information Society Agency should be creative and have different ideas. Of course, I was quiet and easy-going, satisfied with my work, and worked with expertise. I don't know if I was exemplary and gentle enough to be a model for others. As an employee of the National Information Society Agency, I will develop a sense of mission in big data and AI data analysis with a sense of duty in my job with an analytical and critical attitude. *2 years and 7 months of experience in venture company/software development job *From the computer BIOS update program to the company's board diagnostic program, embedded WinCE development, embedded WinCE development, participation in KOFA2000 car fairy tale exhibition at COEX, development website for company introduction, etc. *Learning expertise in hardware and bios, attending seminars for embedded WinCE development, and acquiring expertise in third-party device drivers, etc. * Inform the public about and promote the company as an industrial board producer *3 years and 7 months of experience in manufacturing automation SI / Software engineer's job *Manufacturing equipment CIM development, equipment server development, MCS system development, MES system SM, etc. *From LCD manufacturing equipment team to MES data base system development, 40% contribution to the successful automation setup of LCD manufacturing plant * Establish policies and activation plans to create an intelligent information ecosystem such as big data and artificial intelligence of the National Information Society Agency. Business management on matters related to big data platform and network construction business. Based on expertise in related fields such as information engineering, data engineering, computer engineering, big data, and artificial intelligence, such as big data analysis, data mining, and machine learning, we will maintain an attitude to identify and accept the requirements of various stakeholders. We will learn related business management guidelines and accounting regulations such as ICT business and information and communication R&D with an active and responsible attitude and an analytical and critical attitude to solve problems. Based on our knowledge of the latest ICT issues and trends such as big data and artificial intelligence, we will faithfully carry out our work based on our experience and experience."
"In order to coordinate the opinions of manufacturing equipment engineers, equipment server development engineers, and process engineers while automating the LCD manufacturing of LG displays, it is important to keep a good record of the meeting from the time the meeting is held, and the meeting is important from the initial project design stage. Setting the scope of work development is also coordinated during the meeting, which makes the meeting difficult due to disagreements. Coordination of work is important because the scope that equipment engineers need to develop and the development requirements of most process engineers determine the scope of equipment server development during the project. It was my job to coordinate the requirements of such equipment engineers and process engineers. In order to avoid disruptions to the development schedule, process engineers reflected the requirements in their work, demanded work from equipment engineers, and set up equipment, so the work requirements had to be continuously reflected until the final testing of equipment and processes. And whenever there was a conflict of work, it was necessary to make concessions and consider each other. In order to coordinate the opinions of manufacturing equipment engineers, equipment server development engineers, and process engineers, it is important to keep a good record of the meeting from the time the meeting is held while automating the LCD manufacturing of LG displays. The business meeting is also important from the initial project design stage. Setting the scope of work development is also coordinated during the business meeting, which makes the business meeting difficult due to disagreements. Coordination of work is important because the scope that equipment engineers need to develop and the development requirements of most process engineers determine the scope of equipment server development during the project. It was my job to coordinate the requirements of such equipment engineers and process engineers. In order to avoid disruptions to the development schedule, process engineers reflected the requirements in their work, required work from equipment engineers, and set up equipment, so the work requirements had to be continuously reflected until the final testing of equipment and processes. And whenever there was a conflict of work, it was necessary to make concessions and consider each other. In order to develop a better system, we were pushed into the project schedule and the development schedule was not met, so we reduced the scope of development to carry out the project. At that time, there were four work developments assigned to me, and it was difficult to develop them and how long they could develop them. As I was developing a new system, I had to learn many new technologies, but I finally completed the development, and I completed the development well, and wrote related documents. Most of the developer's concerns disappeared when the project was completed. As I finished the project, all the worries about how much to develop? How to reflect the customer's requirements disappeared. Eventually, I got feedback from people around me that I did a good job on the project. I felt good because the pressure on development, which I had been worried about throughout the project, disappeared, and I was proud of the result that I did a good job. This happened while working on the LG Display P5 plant equipment server development project. We test communication protocols with seven types of LCD equipment. In order to meet each equipment engineer, we personally visit the equipment vendor and ask the process engineer to set a meeting date for the task of interworking testing with the equipment and equipment server, and make a business agreement. When do you do interlocking testing, and there is a task that requires testing using actual glass inside the actual factory, but once you enter the factory, it is inconvenient to come out, so once you enter the factory, you cannot come out until the end of testing. And you can test the system in the factory only when you ask the equipment engineer for work and the process engineer's order falls out. We test the system using all human resources, systems, facilities, etc. The project was successfully completed, and the discord in the initial design was well considered for each other. The experience related to information technology operation of information technology in the field of information and communication of Korea Gas Corporation in the field of computer science and communication is based on the status report of each equipment of LG Display through the equipment CIM of the P4 and P5 factories, the system status of the current equipment, and how the equipment is operating, and receive the instruction of the equipment team automatically through the manufacturing and automation system under the instruction of the upper server. We developed a system that monitors whether the work was done properly in the process with the equipment information received through these tasks, and checks the accuracy of the data values from the upper server. With a series of experience and experience, I think we can do a good job of analyzing all the problems presented through continuous inspection and monitoring of hardware and software in the information and communication-information technology-information technology operation position of Korea Gas Corporation and take appropriate measures for preventive activities and problems that have occurred. As implied by Korea Gas Corporation's words, ""The efforts of Korea Gas Corporation continue today so that all Koreans can draw a better world with good energy."" I believe that the efforts of the Korea Gas Corporation instill trust in people, such as challenges to the world, responsibility to society, changes to the future for a better world, and a better world so that it can be used conveniently and safely by the people of other countries as well as by the gas of the Korean people. While working, I also thought about how my IT value can change the future society and take social responsibility for those changes. And that's what I've been doing. If one small thought has a good influence on future changes, my value will rise, and my efforts will be worthwhile. That's why I acted out of fear and consideration for others, thinking that my selfish behavior might have a negative or negative impact on others.If I have a good energy for others and it has a good effect on others, I would be happy if it was a good thing for others. It was because of the warm heating system of Korea Gas Corporation that I could spend winter warm and safe at home, spring, summer, and fall, and I am surprised and grateful that it was today's effort. I think the value that matches my capability and the value that matches the value of Korea Gas Corporation is a responsibility to society. Is the system I developed right to create a system that can take social responsibility? Isn't there a social responsibility that a person should do to reduce human work by reducing manpower in an increasingly convenient system IT? Wouldn't it be possible to minimize the repetitive work of the person using my system to give him a better warvel and more leisure time after work? Can't my system reduce mistakes in repeated work? I think we need to develop the system in consideration of our responsibility to the society. The kitchen system of today has been more advanced, and it has been a while since an induction electric stove rather than a gas stove was turned on. Now gas is not a gas for cooking, but a gas for heating and supplying warm water. However, there are still many countries that do not use gas in underdeveloped foreign countries. I think there are countless developments of the Korea Gas Corporation in foreign countries. I think we need to supply our gas systems to more foreign countries so that we can become the Korea Gas Corporation of the world, not the Korea Gas Corporation of Korea."
"I applied for the Korea Housing Corporation because of the employment of computerized workers, and the criteria for choosing a job are to have a stable job that suits my aptitude and does what I can. I applied for the computerized job because my major is OOOOOO and I have worked for 6 years and 3 months as a system development worker. I applied for the computerized job in consideration of the annual salary level of new employees. I also liked the purpose of the Korea Housing Corporation, which aims to contribute to the promotion of the welfare of the people and the development of the national economy by promoting long-term and stable supply of housing finance as an institution that improves the welfare of the people. I will play my role as an employee of the Korea Housing Finance Corporation, which strives to improve the quality of life of the people and provide stable housing for the people, with the vision of an institution that improves the quality of life of the people by improving the housing welfare of the people and improves the housing welfare of the people. As the saying goes, ""Homeless Sadness,"" I think that for ordinary people who have been homeless for a long time, creative talents such as Danbi from the Korea Housing Corporation, experts in housing finance business, and a harmonious person with horizontal thinking who knows how to read the hearts of customers, and who can take care of them with a warm heart, I will do my duty as an employee of the public corporation. In the organizational culture, I think that ""open"" mind thinking is a word that is altruistic and incorporates the concept of everyone by respecting and caring for the will of me and others. I think it is not my own thoughts or ideas, but to collect everyone's opinions and narrow the difference of opinion with others by considering others, and reach an appropriate agreement without pursuing only my own interests, unless it is an open mind and respect and consideration for others. While developing the system, I think it is a belief that I should have the ability to persuade others with my conclusions while respecting the opinions of others who have different opinions from me. Just as I need someone to listen to my opinion to accept my opinion, I think the attitude of understanding and accepting the other person's opinion is also a necessary attitude to work with an open mind. The product that I am most interested in, the Bogeumjari Loan, can be applied for the purpose of purchasing a new house, returning jeonse funds, and repaying existing mortgage loans, and it is suitable for customers who want to avoid the risk of future interest rate fluctuations by applying a stable fixed interest rate from the date of loan to maturity. The reason is that it is a fixed-rate mortgage loan that is so low that you must know about Bogeumjari if you want to get a house. In order to become an expert on Bogeumjari products, I will explain in detail the advantages and disadvantages of Bogeumjari Loan, such as application targets, loan interest rates, target housing, adjustment target areas, etc., and explain in detail the advantages and disadvantages of Bogeumjari Loan, such as loan period, repayment method, and income proof method. I will kindly guide the people who want to apply for the Bogeumjari Loan, choose which loan interest rate, determine the repayment period, determine the repayment period, and the necessary documents for receiving the loan. People in their 20s and 30s are in their early social life and are in their early social life, and those in their 20s, who are starting their first social life, will live in a one-room monthly rent room or a house that pays a deposit rather than a vague future dream of getting a house. People in their 30s are more likely to get a new home or start anew with a lease on a deposit basis loan from housing finance or a lease on a deposit basis. People in their 40s and 50s are considered to be at the age when they can use the lease on a deposit basis loan from housing finance or use the lease on a deposit basis loan. People in their 40s and 50s are also considered to be able to use the lease on a deposit basis as well as an increase in their children's housing. I think that people in their 60s are old enough to buy a home for their children or buy a house for retirement. That's why I think it's better to design the role of the Housing Finance Corporation by separating the needs of housing for each age group. It is already being implemented, but I think it will be a reliable housing corporation that will make the housing corporation's wish come true by expanding the housing loan at a lower interest rate with more generality and publicity so that it can benefit the common people and end users who want to buy a home for themselves. My public interest-oriented experience was volunteering to interpret the English translation of OOO OOO OOO OOO OOO athletes' village in 2003. At that time, Daegu City made efforts to attract international sports competitions and establish an athletes' village in Daegu. After the competition, the apartments made for the athletes' village inside and outside the city were returned to ordinary Daegu citizens, and the apartment in Dongbyeon-dong, which was now an athletes' village, has become a private apartment where ordinary citizens live. In fact, some volunteers came to volunteer to win the apartment. It was the first time I knew that the Korea Housing Corporation was engaged in various public interest-oriented activities to fulfill its responsibilities to society. I think something good will happen to you to know that there is a construction called the Korea Housing Corporation for the people as well as the importance of houses."
"""A talent who continues to grow"" I have worked for a startup for a long time and have learned how to effectively apply it to my work by continuously strengthening my capabilities to smoothly perform new tasks. For three years, I have been working at a startup to analyze data and build marketing plans and strategies for digital marketing to brands. Startups have a lot of new work to do, but there is nothing that they have done so far. In startups, capacity building was essential. Recently, I have led the way in building a web based on data as well as analyzing data that I have been doing before. I constantly searched and acquired information on what part to prepare before outsourcing development, produced flowcharts, development requests, and prototyping to hold meetings with developers. After that, I was able to leave a very good impression on each developer I met to select an outsourcing company. Based on the prepared data, the meeting could be concluded easily, and later development was also made smoothly by modifying the plan into a basic frame. In the process, I also learned how to write an outsourced development contract, so I didn't miss out on continuous maintenance and obtaining a source code license. I am a continuously growing talent who knows what to learn, learns about it, and can use the acquired knowledge efficiently even in this ever-changing startup environment."
"""Happy NCsoft"" games are another world and people find joy in games. Pleasure is the emotion that people seek to be happy. So I think that people make games. I think NCsoft, a company that makes games that make people happy, is a company that knows how to make employees happy. Coincidentally, my current job is near NCsoft's Seonneung office building. Sometimes during lunch time, I can see NCsoft's employees proudly hanging their employee ID cards and eating, but it seemed that they were always talking about work. At first, I thought that they were busy enough to work until lunchtime, but the vague stories were conversations about trying to do better. Besides that, it was always impressive to see NCsoft's employees smiling when I saw them coming out of the building. In addition, when I saw various personnel decisions and articles about CEO Taekjin Kim, who is affectionately called ""Lee Hyung,"" I thought that NCsoft is a company that thinks of people and knows how to do great. My company life has always been a challenge. I first encountered data four years ago, and I fell in love with data analysis that can get the correct answer based on the solid basis of data. From data extraction to preprocessing to visualization, I have continuously studied data analysis and experienced the overall data analysis process in practice. In addition, I have periodically developed my competencies through data analysis-related conferences and data analysis training. Four years have passed as a data analyst, but I still want to learn that I have to learn a lot. I think the quality of a good data analyst comes from learning. I want to become a specialist in data analysis by continuously learning many data analysts with the help of seniors and good colleagues at NCSOFT. ""To quench the thirst of clients through data analysis"" The most memorable thing was to have a heated meeting with the strategic planning team of a large company A to continuously communicate on how to search for an advertising model that fits the brand and fit, and to analyze the data according to the needs to derive the desired answer. The reason was that I was able to mobilize all of my knowledge. I think it was an opportunity to refresh my mind at work to find the answer using my knowledge of data analysis to the fullest instead of my previous analysis work as a data analyst. I still can't forget the pleasure of not giving up and writing and weaving all my knowledge to find the answer my client wanted."
"Dear Hiring Manager, It is my great pleasure to have a chance to write this letter to you. While I was preparing for recruitment starting in March, I heard about associate sales engineer analyst within your office through university club member. I received a master’s degree in OOOOO Engineering after graduating from the OO University, Republic of Korea. I aimed to hardware coding experts rather than software since I was a freshman. For this purpose, I completed a course of embedded software coding. I always have thought that applying other techniques allows new perspective. Therefore, I studied many things on my own such as basics of security, multicore programming, and 3D printing. These aspects might be helpful for me to learn new work at your team. I had studied for two years in OOO(OOO-on-OOO) laboratory. In the lab, I have usually researched about development of semiconductor IP especially in part of video codec. I had opportunities of announcements in conferences and handled a lot of documents such as grant reports. So I also have some experiences and skills of office work and MS office software. This makes me more confident with adapting to your company. Please feel free to contact me with any questions at +82-10-OOOO-OOOO or OOO@OO.ac.kr. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. Best Regards, OO Kim   "
"The reason why I chose Pulmuone is a job that suits my corporate image and aptitude. I think the name Pulmuone itself is a company that people who live in Korea and use the mart cannot help but know. Also, Pulmuone is known for its healthy and young image, so I thought it was a company with the corporate culture and development consciousness that I wanted. In addition, I applied because I thought that choosing a job that suits my aptitude is a very important part of my life. When I was a bachelor, my main goal was to become a hardware developer. To this end, I completed the LG Embedded Software Track and took various related classes such as digital engineering, computer structure, digital system design, embedded computing system, operating system, SoC structure and design. Based on this experience, I was interested in semiconductors and went to graduate school to learn more about semiconductor-related jobs. Since then, through the graduate school, I have not only gained deeper knowledge related to hardware, but also gained close experience to practical work. I hope that a place like this will become Pulmuone. I have experience working as an early member of a security club during college. As an early member, I tried to lay the foundation for the club and promote the new club. In addition, we didn't miss gathering in the club to do security learning. For efficiency, we mainly recruited studies in the desired field and conducted learning by participating in them. I was interested in many fields and participated in a number of studies such as database, network, and reverting, and it was difficult to conduct many studies at the same time, but as a result, I realized that I could do anything if I had a strong mindset and effort. Thanks to the efforts of the early members, our club flourished day by day and held simple security competitions within the club. Unfortunately, however, since I graduated, the appearance of the club to visit has changed a lot. Seeing this, I realized that without a clear sense of goal, an organization that had already been established could change, and I was able to be alert again to myself. After entering college, I had vaguely difficult and avoided team activities. However, through the club, team activities are not difficult, but I have come to feel that what I can't do is a wonderful activity where I can do what I can, get help, and work with individuals to perform bigger tasks. This experience reminded me of the team's charm and eliminated vague fear. At the same time, it was a great experience for me to learn that the team is not alone, and if the members of the team do not get the right results, the right results will not come out. My strength is that I have persistence. This is what I have learned by looking at the back of my father who is always working hard in his career. I once did a project in college that I had to study and proceed with by myself what I didn't learn in a major subject. Although I could have carried out a project like an example compilation, I found and studied on my own to complete a project that distinguishes me from other groups, and I received good reviews and contributed to the organization. Also, because of this advantage, until now, I have not given up even if problems arise when developing programs, and have constantly worked to solve errors. Rather, it was an opportunity to improve my SW development ability by being able to find out and learn new things while solving that error. As I have done so far, if there is anything I do not know in the future job, I will continue to work patiently to learn and adapt to the job faster than others. The downside is that I have less knowledge of current events. I think it could be a critical issue, so I am currently reflecting on myself and continuously trying to understand by reading newspapers to fill in my late knowledge of current events. I want to become one of the major developers of the new project 10 years after joining the company. To this end, I will not only strengthen my basic skills, but I will also continue to participate in seminars on the latest technology trends and gain a lot of knowledge. In addition, I think many exchanges create new ideas, so I would like to learn English, Japanese, and Chinese as well as the current foreign language skills and create new exchanges and new ideas accordingly. Furthermore, I want to become a developer who can develop more efficient and better systems by developing not only considering software but also hardware."
"I have acquired a lot of software-related knowledge through my university course, and I am especially confident in embedded software coding that is closely related to the operating system. Since then, I have developed and tested HEVC's CABAC encoder and decoder, one of the most commonly used high-definition video codecs in the lab for two years, and developed IP with my master's graduation work and conducted MPW to write a thesis. I learned the background knowledge necessary for research by helping develop and test the encoder like a senior for the first year, and I studied and completed the development on my own for the second year. In addition, by managing tasks in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations, I have gained basic practical knowledge and the ability to freely handle document tools, and have become more familiar with coding on the Linux environment. Various education and conferences that I participated in, such as neuromorphic hardware courses for the realization of future artificial intelligence, also gave me a lot of background knowledge and enlightenment. I'm sure that my hands-on experience in the lab and development in a team with my seniors will help me quickly adapt to the Korea Tourism Organization. I have been to OO as an overseas volunteer. In my own way, I studied and prepared English in advance in order to sufficiently conduct preliminary research on the local area in Korea and overcome the language difference, which is the basis of communication. However, most of the Nepalese who actually did not know English. Basically, the language, diet, and culture were all different, so I thought a lot about what to do to really communicate with them. And I got a hint from the behavior of one of the team members. The team member was just talking to the children in Korean. Although the actual language did not work, I realized from this experience that if there is a sincere effort to convey the intention, my heart can be conveyed. During the next period, I also tried to share my heart with anything, and through that, I was able to gain a rewarding experience. Also, at the same time, I realized the importance of preliminary research and background knowledge. When I wanted to go to graduate school, I faced my mother's opposition. In order to resolve my mother's conflict and persuade her, I thought that I needed to first know what she really wanted, and I also felt that I needed to have a lot of conversations with her. So, over the course of several months, I had deep conversations with my mother about this. Through this conversation, I was able to understand my mother's opinion in various aspects, not only in terms of going to graduate school, which was the problem I encountered at the time. Through this experience, I came to realize that time to share opinions is essential in an organization, and this was an opportunity to broaden my understanding of how to achieve harmony among organizations through sharing opinions. As its name suggests, the Korea Tourism Organization is carrying out a number of tourism-related projects. It can be broadly divided into international and domestic tourism, and it carries out detailed businesses such as marketing, public relations, planning, and welfare. Marketing is mainly conducted for international and domestic tourism planning products. In addition to supporting public relations and providing translation-related projects for international customers, public relations are also carried out. Planning plans new tourism projects through various fields that enhance Korea's status, and finally, welfare is carrying out projects in many fields, such as many welfare services to revitalize domestic tourism projects and direct vacation support projects."
"I applied for East-West Power because I want to participate in helping people live a convenient life and protecting their safety. v I have a lot of experience in volunteer work and have been interested in helping people since a long time ago. Especially, going to volunteer work in person during the Taean oil spill made me think a lot and have an interest in environmental issues. Since then, I have been interested in various environmental issues and have engaged in various activities, including participating in Abaz, an international organization. After years of hard work while continuing these activities, I applied because I thought that although it may not be seen well from the outside, taking care of basic management and helping people is the way to save my dream. Ten years after joining the company, I want to become one of the major developers of the new project. To this end, I will not only strengthen my basic skills but also continue to participate in seminars on the latest technology trends to gain a lot of knowledge. In addition, as I think many exchanges are creating new ideas, I would like to learn not only the current foreign language skills but also English, Japanese, and Chinese as well as new exchanges and new ideas accordingly. Furthermore, I would like to become a developer who can develop more efficient and good systems through development that considers hardware as well as software. As far as I know, Korea East-West Power is currently carrying out several renewable energy generation projects. I think this is the right path for the future and for the environment. However, it would be better if I could manage energy more efficiently and find out which energy is more efficient. I would like to develop a new program so that I can grasp it more clearly through IT technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence that are also used in marketing. My competitiveness is deep knowledge based on dreams I have had since the first year of college. When I was a student, my main goal was to become a hardware developer, but I had to overcome it. I had no background knowledge related to hardware, which was my weakness. To overcome this weakness, I took various related classes such as digital engineering, computer structure, digital system design, embedded computing system, operating system, SoC structure and design. Based on this experience, I was interested in semiconductors and went to graduate school to learn more about semiconductor-related jobs. Since then, through the graduate school, I have not only gained deeper knowledge related to hardware but also gained experience close to practical work. I will try to utilize such practical experience and team experience t persistence."
"Since I was a freshman in university, I have completed the embedded software coding track presented by the department and studied all electronic circuit classes, aiming to become a hardware coding expert rather than a software expert. In addition, I received education such as basic information security and multi-core programming using GPUs, aiming at coding from various perspectives using the time of vacation. Since then, I have been learning background knowledge related to semiconductor since I went to graduate school, thinking that semiconductor is the ultimate hardware coding. I have mainly developed and tested the CABAC decoder of HEVC, one of the video codecs, for two years in the lab. As I developed it, I became familiar with basic semiconductor development using Verilog HDL. After completing the development, I even went to the MPW packaging process to gain experience in circuit development tools such as Synopsys and Cadence. In addition, I have gained the ability to freely handle basic necessary practical knowledge and document tools by managing tasks in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations. I am confident that such practical experience in the lab and experience in developing in teams with seniors will help me quickly adapt to the company. Since childhood, I had many opportunities to encounter S/W such as computers and games. So, I was basically interested in programming and naturally chose to major in information, communication, and electronics. Until I entered university, I mainly liked working on projects alone, but one experience made me realize the importance and strength of teamwork. In one of the major subjects of the department, I carried out a patented product development planning team project using wireless communication technology. This required a large amount of work, such as not only planning new products but also preliminary patent research on the planned products, assuming that patents are issued. First of all, we exchanged contacts and made sure that we could always discuss them through messenger. In addition, we had regular meetings and had frequent opportunities to discuss them. At first, I started by coming up with and presenting various topics for a new plan. Several plans came out, but all of them thought their plans were good and wanted to adopt their plans. So, we discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each plan with each other and decided the topic by a majority vote. After the topic was decided, the work of researching patents, writing proposals, and writing presentation materials was divided equally into areas that I could do well. I researched and organized patents and helped write presentation materials. When I divided the work into my field efficiently, I felt that it was progressing much smoother and faster than otherwise. In addition, by gaining a lot of opportunities to discuss, I was able to complete the project more completely because I was able to consider areas that I could not think on my own and consider details. Based on these experiences, I learned that when the team worked together, I could achieve my perfect goal more efficiently. The above experience is one of the most memorable and valuable experiences for me, and it was an opportunity to realize that individual strength is important, but when the power of many people is properly gathered, even greater and greater results can be achieved. Based on this experience, I would like to play a role in the development of the company as one of the developers who contribute to development while maintaining good teamwork."
"""Fusion of strengths and weaknesses"" The new trend of life is 'infinity' which means that nothing can be achieved without sweating. Also, I think its strength is 'depth'. In-depth efforts and knowledge are essential for continuous software service improvement and optimization, not one-time development. When I was an undergraduate, I tried to understand in depth based on the lessons learned when I planned a project. Taking classes in mechanical engineering and electronic engineering, which are other departments, I tried to learn basic mechanical programming and algorithms for HW control, with the theme of a project using drones. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that if you focus on one thing, you will be somewhat neglected in other things. In order to solve this problem, I prepared weekly planners, prioritizing important tasks, and made efforts to live a school life on a planned basis. After joining the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation, I will try to process things by fusing strengths and weaknesses, and derive in-depth results. ""The Value of Developing Together"" Since the 2nd grade, I opened an algorithm study to learn how to fuse various solutions based on communication from the experiences I studied. We solved algorithm problems and reviewed codes once a week with friends from the same department. In the process, we tried to come up with a solution rather than memorizing one standardized method. And by posting what we studied on an IT blog, we were able to grow deeply by sharing opinions with people with similar interests. In the third grade, students who are interested in coding and algorithms also participated in the study. It was an opportunity to solidify the foundations that were passed by the mentor activities on basic algorithms to those students. Also, based on that knowledge sharing, we were able to work as a team with business management friends in creative app classes, and we were able to derive a joint result of catching two rabbits, economic feasibility and technology called ""Drone Safe Homecoming APP."" ""Inconvenience, Driving the Development"" project was able to learn about the practical experience of using the framework and the use of SQL. By accessing the web page, we designed a program that allows information exchange in real time by making the written contents accessible from all users' screens. In addition, the drawing board function was added to explain the data structure together. In addition, the Spring framework MVC pattern was used and implemented as a responsive web. As a result, it was evaluated that information exchange is possible in an equal environment regardless of the device or the device they have, and they were able to win the Presidential Award upon completion of the undergraduate program. The experience of approaching the answer as a development rather than accepting the inconvenience will provide a foothold for the efficient management of IT projects at the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation. The system that manages illegal waste in advance by checking the type, amount brought in, and area of generated waste, and the system that manages the unloading and management of mobile-based waste by operating an IT-based integrated measuring stand, inspired enthusiasm for work. This is because I think it is a technology that considers not only convenience but also the safety of members of society. After joining the company, first, I will become a developing developer. I will participate in seminars and forums to study the latest IT technologies such as AI, cloud, and big data, and make efforts to build an innovative and convenient environment. Second, I will become a developer who suggests directions for improvement from various angles. We will explore more efficient algorithms of existing services and strive to provide services that are flexibly applicable to requirements. Based on these experiences, we will be reborn as a talented person who contributes to the development of the Seoul Metropolitan Landfill Management Corporation."
"My goal after joining the company is to establish a complete security system for network technology that will continue the next generation of 5G. As a generation that has used communication from the 2G era to the current 5G, I have always been interested in network technology that is closely related to my life. I have always looked at it, feeling the security issues that cannot be separated from him. In conclusion, I think it is necessary to innovate security technology according to the development of network technology. I applied for this job because I decided to follow the path accordingly. I would like to learn another language, including English and Japanese, which are my foreign language skills, within the next two years after obtaining an information security technology license. The purpose is to establish better security technology by interacting with talented people abroad based on solid background knowledge. In addition, I would like to work as another mainstay of KT in the team that establishes the foundation of a perfect security system within 10 years and implements it. I have experience working as an early member of a security club during college. As an early member, I tried to lay the foundation of the club and promote the new club. In addition, we did not miss gathering together in the club for security learning. For efficiency, we mainly recruited studies in the desired field and conducted learning by participating in them. I was interested in many fields and participated in a number of studies, and it was difficult to conduct many studies at the same time, but as a result, I realized that I could do anything with a firm mindset and effort. Thanks to the efforts of the early members, our club flourished day by day and held simple security competitions within the club. Unfortunately, however, since I graduated, the appearance of the club has changed a lot. Seeing this, I was able to realize that without a clear sense of goal, an organization that had already been created could deteriorate, and I was able to be alert again about myself. For two years during my master's course, I had the experience of developing and testing HEVC's CABAC encoder and decoder, one of the high-definition video codecs mainly used in the lab. Among them, the HEVC CABAC decoder was my main research field, and I developed IP as my master's graduation work and conducted it to MPW to write a thesis. For the first year, I learned the background knowledge necessary for research by helping the development and testing of the encoder like my senior, and for the second year, I studied and completed the development on my own. In addition, I was able to freely handle the basic necessary practical knowledge and document tools by managing the assignments in the lab, writing necessary materials, and conducting presentations, and various education and conferences I participated in, such as neuromorphic hardware courses for the realization of future artificial intelligence, gave me a lot of background knowledge and enlightenment. Such background knowledge and testing experience in video, practical experience in the lab, and experience in developing with seniors, will help me adapt quickly in KT, and I am confident that I will become a member of KT faster than anyone else."
"It was a job that I really wanted to do, and I applied because I wanted to work with you by learning more experience and know-how through the teachings of my seniors. It is because I thought it was a company that could fully demonstrate my ability and feel confident and rewarding to grow in a better way through the basic knowledge and expertise I learned in my major. Everyone wants to work in the field that they can do well and they like, and doing so will increase efficiency and bring results. That's why I applied for IBM Korea, where I can do and do what I like the most. It is to develop and operate the web application that the customer demands, and to develop, modify, and maintain systems such as JAVA-based web application and Mobile in the new system development and operation project. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Programming using the JAVA language fits well with my personality, who likes a logical and systematic way of thinking. That's why I chose this path because I thought the programmer was suitable for my aptitude. I want to become an expert in the field of S/W development by learning the rapidly changing IT technologies these days. And I will continue to learn about the changing advanced IT technologies in the future, and even if I face a difficult situation, I will overcome it and achieve my goal to the end. I think it is necessary to have various skills and an open mind in order to survive in the ever-changing IT industry. I will be a developer who always studies and strives with the above abilities. I will be a talented person who will lead the growth of IBM Korea. I want to share the passion I want to do with IBM Korea. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Converting it into a score, it is converted into 6.5 out of 10. I have worked on a C language-related project in my major subject called computer programming. It was a project to make a program that implements a puzzle of n*n array, and it was an experience that gave me a new function that others have not thought of other than the existing puzzle function. Due to the nature of the program development project, it was a task to refer to the existing source code, but never copy the same, and to produce it on your own. So, new variables were added in addition to the existing source code to facilitate the program's operation, new additional functions were added to make it possible to know the time and number of movements it takes to complete the puzzle, and a function to add a DOMISOL sound when completing the puzzle and to execute a warning sound when moving the puzzle in the wrong place was added. It was an experience that I tried in a new direction with a unique idea, and I received good marks for new functions when judging the completion of the project. In addition, I have experience working on JAVA-related projects in my major subject called smart device programming. I wrote to receive the type value of Hanoi tower and the number of disc using a scanner class, designed to move disc using a recursive algorithm, created a stack necessary for driving the Hanoi tower, and wrote various methods to move the disc. It made it implement the graphical element of the tower in Hanoi, and completed it similar to the actual tower game in Hanoi. I had enough time while I was working on my graduation work, but I wasn't ready at all. A total of three team members, myself included, shared their opinions, and with the advice of my advisor and the help of my lab assistant, I decided to select a topic called a drone flight system that applied LED-ID. I didn't know how to proceed, so I was really at a loss. However, all of the team members joined forces to start. It was my first time to experience video processing and embedded programming, and we proceeded by firmly sharing each other's roles. There were many cases where I stayed up all night until dawn to create works with the goal of completion, and there was a difficulty in finding necessary parts. Even during vacation, I came to the lab and proceeded with the project. Meanwhile, I became even more passionate when I first flew a drone into the sky. As a result, we were able to successfully display our work at the graduation exhibition, and all of the team members received a grade of A+. I was very happy that we achieved the goal of completion without having any equipment. Although it was an uncertain situation where the results could not be guaranteed, I think the experience achieved by challenging became an important asset for me in my future life. If I join IBM Korea, I will become an employee who sets goals and conducts my work in a challenging manner even in uncertain situations."
"He has been a curious child since he was young. I was able to answer questions without fail, and I have a habit of saying ""Why?"" This habit seems to have become the cornerstone for me to develop my creative problem-solving skills as an adult. I think it is a happy thing to have a solid goal in life, and I have lived a sincere life by putting my best efforts into everything to become a person who can take responsibility for my future since my school days. When I was a child, I admired the sky and made model airplanes. Since then, I have been working hard to achieve my dream of becoming an engineer. After going through middle and high school, where I liked to hang out with my friends, I was able to meet people and share my joy through various part-time jobs and club activities within the school. I think that the strength of my personality is that I have a positive mindset and an excellent eye for the whole flow. That's why I tend to learn and learn things quickly. I always work with a mindset that if I live with confidence, I can see the fruits I want, and when I take on a task, I do my best to handle it responsibly. I am calm and meticulous in my personality, so I tend to be careful in everything. I tend to be careful, so I'm misunderstood as an introvert, but I'm actually active, likes to make friends, and I have an active personality. The downside is that I lack a little seriousness and sometimes act lightly, but I'm trying to become a person who thinks twice before acting, and I'm also listening to the advice of my friends. I have a strong sense of responsibility, so I hate postponing my work until the next day, whether it's an appointment or a job that makes me stressed out if I couldn't finish a given day's work. In this respect, I may seem a little bit of a snobbish, but if I didn't have a snobbish side, wouldn't I have lost my ability to finish clearly and neatly? People who see me for the first time say that I have a clear argument and unexpectedly stubborn when I do team activities together. It's because I try to actively suggest opinions and it becomes a bit excessive, but I try to listen to others carefully to overcome it. While majoring in IT, I gained a lot of knowledge, and I also made several programs mainly using C language and JAVA. Among them, embedded programming was really interesting. The experience of programming on other hardware and temperature measurement sensor manufacturing using Arduino also interested me in the field of embeddedness. And I have experience in manufacturing LED board with the ability to display time using MCU(ATmega128), acquired expertise in voltage and current characteristics of passive element such as resistor, inductor, capacitor, and various circuit analysis techniques that can analyze circuit composed of DC power and passive element are understood by understanding filter characteristics by using frequency characteristics of passive element according to AC power, acquired in-depth knowledge of circuit analysis such as over-analysis by switch operation and circuit analysis method using Laplace conversion, studied the concept of semiconductor element and theory of circuit design, and experienced circuit design through regular practice using circuit design program (mainly Orcad-spice). In addition, while studying digital engineering, I developed the ability to understand, analyze and design digital circuits, started with code and Boolean algebra, and learned about the understanding and application of combination circuits, as well as the understanding and application of combination circuits, and digital electronic circuit design and optimization methods. I have experience in making a watch that lasts 24 hours using 7-SEGMENT after connecting the device directly to the breadboard by referring to the given circuit diagram using a breadboard and various IC devices. To understand the basic properties of VECTOR, COULOMB's law, full speed, GAUSS's law, electric energy, conductor and dielectric, capacitance, imaging current, and to understand the phenomena and applications of the electromagnetic field, the properties of current, the static magnetic field in vacuum, the force between magnetic field and current, the magnetic circuit, the electromagnetic induction phenomenon, the electromagnetic field, the motion, discharge phenomenon, and thermomagnetic radiation of charged particles were studied while studying electromagnetism. While studying wireless communication systems, I learned about the outline, technological trends, and technical specifications of various standardized wireless communication systems based on IEEE 802. I studied the basic theory and application of data communication. In particular, I studied the concepts and practices of various network technologies, including data link protocols, transmission media and transmission methods, multiplexing, coding, and error control methods. I practiced driving digital signal processing simulations using MATLAB. In the drone flight system using LED-ID, which was implemented as a graduation work, I used Raspberry Pi to adjust the speed of the motor and recognize the signals through the cell phone flash and light source. The experience of installing a camera module to attach it to the drone so that I can see the surrounding landscape on the screen and recognize the intensity of light. It was a pleasant experience for me to feel like I was gradually entering the machine as if I was peeling an onion. I was also interested in semiconductor jobs, so I took external education related to semiconductors, studied the contents of the eight major semiconductor processes and semiconductor process equipment. It was a job that I really wanted to do, and I applied because I wanted to work with your company and learn more experience and know-how through the teachings of my seniors. This is because I thought it was a company that could fully demonstrate my abilities and feel confident and rewarding to grow into a better shape through the basic knowledge and expertise I learned in my major. Everyone wants to work in a field they can do well and like, and doing so will increase efficiency and bring resultsThat's why I applied to your company where I can do the things I like the most. In addition, based on the experience of the entire company, I applied to your company with the ability and confidence to handle any tasks that are given. If I join the company, I will definitely try to become the person I need anywhere and do my best to make my abilities and qualities a driving force for your development. In addition, I will do my best in small things and always be a person who is recognized by anyone by doing everything with a learning attitude."
"In the early days of college, I vaguely avoided team projects after hearing only bad rumors about them. However, I realized that it was a weakness and rather took subjects that included team projects, such as an O(1) scheduler implementation project in the operating system subject and a landmine search design project using an FPGA board. In addition to classes, I wanted to make team projects my actual experience, such as participating in autonomous team projects in schools. As a result, I was able to get used to team activities and gain a lot of enlightenment such as presentation skills, communication skills within the team, and the efficiency of group activities based on the allocation of tedious tasks. I have been to OO before. I thought I had done enough preliminary research on the local area in Korea, but Nepal and the people living there showed a different appearance than I thought. Basically, language, diet, and culture were many different things, so I thought a lot about what to do to truly communicate with them. And I got a hint from the behavior of one of the team members. The team member was just talking to the children in Korean. Although real language did not work, I realized through this experience that my heart can be conveyed if there is a sincere effort to communicate. During the subsequent period, I also tried to share my feelings with each other in anything, and through that, I was able to gain a rewarding experience. When I wanted to go to graduate school, I faced my mother's opposition. I thought that in order to resolve my conflict with my mother and persuade her, I first needed to know what she really wanted, and I also felt that a lot of conversation with her was necessary. So, over the course of months, I had a deep conversation with my mother about this. Through this conversation, I was able to understand my mother's opinion in various aspects, not only the problem I encountered at the time, but also through various persuasions, she eventually opened up and allowed me to go to graduate school. Through this experience, I realized that time to share opinions in an organization is essential, and this was also an opportunity to broaden my understanding of how to achieve harmony in an organization through sharing opinions. I am a communicator. During my college life, I used my vacation to carry out continuous volunteer activities such as educational service, restaurant assistance, and management, and I have conducted team activities through on-campus work, club vice president, and short-term part-time jobs. Through this, I have gained a lot of experience in making friends with the members of the group and working toward a single goal. I am sure that this experience is my foundation."
"""Reading the World Expressed by Data"" Since childhood, I have tried to understand the importance of data and create value through it. When I was in high school, I witnessed many friends who were not interested in studying get scolded for running away during self-study time at night. As the class president at the time, I presented a probability model based on data called attendance book on whether a supervisor would come in. Based on this, they established an attendance strategy, and as a result, our class had the image that they were more eager to study than other classes. I went to the Department of Statistics according to the tendency to quantify reality and accurately judge it and suggest strategies. In the Department of Statistics, I was able to learn about various statistical theories and how to deal with data. However, I thought that there was a lot of lack of integration into the industry with only my knowledge of statistics, and by the fourth grade, I entered the OOO lab as an undergraduate research student. While the undergraduate program could only study structured data that existed in numbers, the lab could handle a lot of unstructured data. I was able to learn various methodologies for data analysis and analysis of things that were difficult to analyze objectively in the past, such as images and texts, and based on this, it was possible to find characteristics. LINE, a global company, aims to become a data scientist who deals with various kinds of data and creates meaningful value. ""A strong sense of ownership"" In addition to the given task, I work with a sense of ownership toward the group I belong to. I liked meeting new people, so I volunteered at the museum as a keeper of the exhibition room for a year. Visitors wanted to hear expert commentary, but the commentary time was set, so they often went back without hearing it. Looking at the people who were going back with regret, I thought that if I could let them know, I would have a better memory in the museum. Therefore, after studying about the exhibits personally, I kindly informed them whenever necessary. After the viewing in the museum, we conducted a survey, and many people mentioned thank you for the additional explanation. Through this, it has contributed to enhancing the image of the museum by being recognized by the commentator and the director. I will join LINE and have a higher sense of ownership than anyone else. In addition, based on this sense of ownership, I will build the trust of my colleagues and cooperate to bring out good results. ""Early adopter for Ideas"" In order to get new ideas, I read and organized the latest papers and explained them to my team members. When I was a senior at university, I belonged to OOO's laboratory and worked on many projects. Most of the research projects were done, and the purpose was to present new algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence. As an undergraduate researcher, when professors and seniors set a topic, I read and organized as many of the latest papers as possible. While sharing the data organized during the meeting, I explained the characteristics of each paper so that team members could quickly and easily understand it. In addition, new ideas were presented by fusion of the techniques used in the paper. By drawing a lot of inspiration from the latest papers, a new model could be developed, and good results were obtained by using new technologies in a different way."
"I have experienced many fields related to data, such as ""passion and diverse experiences in data analysis"" statistics and machine learning. I was able to learn about various statistical theories and how to deal with data in my major, the Department of Statistics. However, I thought that there were many shortcomings in applying only statistical knowledge to the industry, so I studied the field of machine learning on my own. In addition, not only theories but also various projects were carried out by entering the school's big data society. In addition to Kaggle's data set, I was able to crawl data existing on the web and apply methodologies learned while dealing with various types of data. By the fourth grade, I entered the OOO laboratory to experience a high-quality project closer to the field. There were many difficulties in living in the lab in parallel with the undergraduate class. In order to proceed with the project, master's and doctoral degrees had to study on their own the techniques they considered basic knowledge. I organized the minutes so as not to miss the meeting, and studied day and night without a weekend to participate in the project even a little more. Through this, I was able to learn various technologies that are not covered in undergraduate courses, such as heterogeneous data processing methods and natural language processing, and I was able to experience many projects. Based on these experiences and passion, I want to become a data scientist who creates value from data created by various services provided by Kakao. ""Early adopter for Ideas"" I constantly study to keep up with the latest trends in machine learning and deep learning, where new technologies continue to emerge. Belonging to OOO's laboratory, we developed a model to discriminate deepfake images. We needed a large amount of images to create a discriminant model, and we thought that the next generation of deep learning techniques called GAN (Generative Adversarial Network, 2014) could be utilized. Therefore, I looked up the latest papers related to GAN from influential societies such as ICML and NIPS, as well as search engines. We were able to find stable and high-performance algorithms, and we wrote a paper using them. Through this paper, we were able to win the Best Paper Award at OOO."
"I applied to Hummus-on to become a developer who communicates and makes a difference in the times. For the last 10 months, I have been working as a mentor at a mentoring group for college students to develop my communication skills. It was because I felt it was valuable to listen to someone and help them find their dreams. However, I realized that there was no finding my dream in that life, so I tried to become a developer of my dream again. I studied algorithms again from the programming language grammar that I had forgotten for a while. While taking the OO Online Jersey lecture, I studied BOJ problems with the goal of 3 questions a day. I have been studying continuously for more than 5 hours every day to establish my basic skills. When I was studying OOOO language, I was offered an internship in charge of website development and IT at the language school I attended. At that time, I was a new developer who only learned for 3 semesters, but I challenged because I was interested in a new job and didn't want to miss this opportunity. At first, I had never thought about web programming, so I started with only a passion for new development. After finishing class at the language school, I went to the IT department of the language school, Googling for 5 hours every day, watched daily coding videos, and studied web programming. Starting with the most basic HTML and CSS, I studied WordPress, which I used a lot at the time. As a result, I was able to study the basics of web programming for a year and develop my first ever website safely. 'Meeting' I express that I meet new things as well as people. I like to meet new people because I have a good affinity and I get to know them quickly. Also, I am very curious and like to meet new things. Whenever I meet new things in my daily life, I always analyze what technologies they are made of, and I like them because they stimulate my passion. There is a 'Trying' when I am hooked on one thing, I try to become passionate until I become passionate. When I was an undergraduate, when I first learned and did not understand the C language for the first time, I studied while attending a C language academy in Seoul until I worked part-time. I want to be a humble helper who makes a change of the times by meeting and communicating with new people at Hummus On with persistence."
"""How to Use Data"" How to use data determines the rise and fall of a company. Identifying the products that people want and buy, locating the items that are displayed, or deciding to sell are key points in distribution companies. Also, recently, people often see products to be purchased offline and purchase them online at an affordable price, and through this, we have to understand people's needs. I think this job has the potential to develop in the future because digital is the most effective way to grasp data. As a consumer who actually purchases goods online, when I purchase goods, I receive a recommendation notice on the distribution company's website stating that it is the 'perfect product for you'. I often purchase more goods from them because I understood my needs. Looking at this, I applied as a digital job to use my major to understand the needs of customers and to increase the competitiveness of the company. My life has changed after reading the book ""Miracle Morning, Change My Life"" and ""Miracle Morning."" I was living a normal life without much standing out. Then, just before I was discharged from the military, I happened to read a book called Miracle Morning. The content of the book was about waking up in the morning, investing an hour in self-improvement, gaining the initiative in life, and achieving what you want. I thought it was a necessary part for me, who became a habit of sleeping late. So, I woke up at 6 a.m. from March and invested 15 minutes in stretching, chin-ups, reading books, and diary. I wanted to take both my body and mind to the next level. After being discharged from the military, I practiced consistently and felt that my efforts were shining. As my physical strength improved and my mind became comfortable, I felt that my work was going well. As my graduation work, I produced RC cars using LeapMotion with my team members, participated in a competition, and received both a Popularity Award and an Encouragement Award in recognition of its novel input device. In addition, I obtained an electrician license with a passing rate of about 10 percent, and was able to graduate with a credit of 4.38 in the last semester. Increasingly, I felt that I was becoming a person who could do what I decided to do. ""Sound Love, Acoustic Band Club."" The part that I am most interested in other than studying is music. I have been an acoustic band club ever since I entered university. I was the vocalist and keyboard in the band, and performed regularly, on festival stages, and on the street to college once a semester. In December 2015, my brother got married and asked my clubmates if I could sing in the wedding. They all liked to perform, so I readily agreed. So, I met them every weekend during the semester and practiced for about a month and a half before singing. It was the second semester of my third year, so I was really grateful that all of my classmates practiced together even though they were busy. My parents, brother, and I were happy, so the wedding day was the best and the most memorable moment of my life. For me, my brother's wedding day was a day when I realized my life goals small. I was unable to help financially because I was a college student, but I was able to congratulate him as much as I could through club activities during my college life. In this way, my goal is to become a person who benefits people around me with my ability, and now I want to benefit people professionally through digital jobs. ""RC Cars Using LeapMotion, Transferring Wireless Data with Pyhton"" We started producing graduation works with the aim of winning the contest in October. We implemented the project with a group of three members, and decided to produce a 2WD RC car using LeapMotion. The work was to control the motor after sending the input received through LeapMotion to Raspberry Pi via wireless communication. Since we used two wheels, we implemented directional change using the speed difference between the wheels. I was in charge of Socktprogramming to send LeapMotion's DATA to Raspberry Pi here. The language used Python, and the slope of the bottom of the hand was divided into X-axis and Y-axis to send data, implementing the common speed of each wheel and the additional speed of each wheel. These data were required at the same time, and they were transmitted in a matrix through Packaging, and then unpackaged again and transmitted to Raspberry Pi. These data were used to control the PWM signal of the Arm processor connected to Raspberry Pi, and there was one problem. As the motor rotated, the data transmitted from the input end was broken. When I checked the data through debugging, only the high data was output with 0xFFFF. As a result of studying the motor to determine the cause, the problem was that back electromotive force was generated as the motor rotates, which collides with the existing data. So, noise was removed by adding a Bypass filter to the motor, and the problem could be solved. ""The distant viewer wins."" Those who have a clear long-term goal are more likely to overcome difficulties than those who do not, and the work efficiency is higher because they know the direction. During the internship period, I would like to find out the customer's data regarding distribution. I would like to build customized data through the products that customers decide to purchase, the products that they clicked on but did not purchase, the reason why, and the services that identify frequently purchased items and provide them to customers. In addition, within the next five years, we will figure out how to attract overseas customers by grasping data on overseas customers using DB construction capabilities and English capabilities, which are advantages. And in 10 years, I will be in charge of building Lotte's own strong distribution network through the human network I have built up and nurturing juniors."
"As I became a third grader in the ""Electronic Circuit, Pulse Measurement Project,"" I took an electronic circuit class that I wanted to listen to, and I came to produce a pulse measurement circuit as a practical practice. It is largely composed of three stages: the sensor unit, the filter unit, and the amplifier unit. The sensor unit recognized the pulse rate using the male and female light emitting units, and the filter unit used the Op-amp to construct a bandpass filter. In the last amplification unit, the signal of the weak pulse was amplified. I was able to develop my ability to see the whole circuit, and I was able to study the principle of recognizing the pulse. One year of Struggle, Motor Control"" The project was carried out by a group of three and decided to manufacture a 2WD RC car using LeapMotion. Since I used two wheels, I thought I should change direction by using the difference in speed of the wheels. So, I chose to send data by dividing the slope of the palm into the X-axis and the Y-axis, and since I needed these data at the same time, I transmitted it to the matrix through Packaging and utilized it again. The input of LeapMotion enabled motor control, but the duration was about 5 seconds. As a result of thinking about the cause, noise generated by rotating the brush motor distorted the input. After checking this with an oscilloscope, the Bypass filter stage was constructed using capacitors and inductors accordingly. While solving this problem, I wanted to give up in the middle, but the fact that the team members agreed to make sure to solve the problem was a big driving force. As a result, I went to the competition and won both the Excellence Award and the Encouragement Award. ""Impedance Measurement Circuit"" As an intern, I worked on a project to make a human impedance measurement circuit and print it to a PC. It measures the impedance of a human body by applying a sin wave (constant current source) of 100 kHz. The entire process was in the order of business plan, system block diagram, circuit design, material order, PCB layout order, soldering, debugging, and firmware design. The circuit is largely composed of a power supply part, a signal generator, and a measurement circuit. First, the human body can die if more than 50 mA of ventricular fibrillation current flows, so the primary side and the secondary side are insulated from each other by a switching regulator and a transformer at the power supply part. And as an output, the positive voltage and negative voltage of ±5V were created. The signal generator applied a PWM signal from the MCU and generated a sin wave through the third LPF to generate a signal, which was converted into a current through a V-I converter to implement a constant current source. Since noise is applied to the signal by noise from the switching regulator and noise from external fluorescent lights in the measurement circuit afterwards, a full-wave rectification circuit and LPF were implemented and applied to the ADC to obtain the average value. The ADC and MCU exchanged data through SPI communication, and the MCU and PC output the impedance measured through UART communication through the PC."
"The criteria that I choose a company is its management style and vision. 'A company that creates value by increasing customer confidence through customer-centered innovation.' I believe that the value of a company is created by its customers, and Hana Financial TI, which approaches with a customer-centered mind based on customer trust, is the ideal management method of the company. This was a big reason for me to choose Hana Financial TI. When I first decided to become a developer, my ultimate goal was to see as many people as possible use the programs I have contributed to conveniently. Financial services are a service that always exists next to one person, but financial services are a service that always exists firmly to one person, and I want to become a digital financier by contributing to the development of programs that each customer needs. As above, my goal after joining the company is to create a program that many people use comfortably and pleasantly. I want to become the best developer who provides the best services to customers with the flow and understanding of the process I learned while using financial programs. Due to my timid personality when I was a child, I often did not even try many things I wanted to do, but as I grew up, I decided to change my personality and tried to live a positive and challenging life because I thought that if I lived a passive life and hid myself, I would be able to do nothing. I have always lived in a challenging and passionate attitude. I have had many experiences, and I would like to talk about myself through two of them. I had a tablet, and it was a model that did not support versions 2.3 or later through OS upgrades. Later version 4.0 came out, and I wanted to use the new version, but as soon as I was thinking about buying a new tablet, I searched the Internet, wondering if there was any other way to use it. Then I saw an article that 4.0 version could be used with my Galaxy Tab if I distributed it within an Internet cafe and manually updated it through loading. Although loading was not illegal, I realized that A/S support was not possible after I did it, but I thought it was necessary to improve the speed, so I put it into action. ""Dieting is not just about changing your appearance."" Until high school, the word ""obesity"" was always a word that never left me. Being obese often hurt my peers and others. During the winter vacation of my second year of high school, I set a goal of losing 20 kilograms through diet control while exercising. The fruit of success was really sweet. I have made friends with friends I have always liked, and I have realized the importance of self-care in other people's attitudes before. There is a saying that a person with a heavy butt is a winner. Of course, sitting for a long time does not mean good things, but good things come when you work with persistence. This requires physical strength. It consumes a lot of physical strength both when studying and working, so it requires physical strength. I want to become a person who shines through persistent efforts based on my physical strength. I believe that the physical fitness I am currently doing is not only about external changes but also the foundation that will help me build my skills and capabilities, and I am working hard and will continue to train without giving up. Being passionate and challenging anything is not always the right attitude. It may be an impossible reckless challenge or a challenge that adversely affects me, but I tried to make a change with the idea that 'it is better to do it and regret it than not do it and regret it'. Among the sites run by the university, there is a site called the industry-academic management system. There are many subjects in the engineering college class that work on projects in connection with companies, and they are subjects that work on projects through thematic matching with companies. I am currently in charge of maintaining and repairing a homepage called the industry-academic management system, which is used to match topics with companies and report projects with other student developers. It is being developed using node.js, and it is playing a role in developing new menus or functions that users such as professors or companies want, or correcting errors. Recently, we have been working on making manuals for students, professors, and mentors who are using this site for the first time, and are preparing to renew the site to provide more convenient services. This project is planned to be in charge by this year, so I will take responsibility for it until I find and hand it over to a trusted successor. Through the above experience, I was able to learn how to deal with specific plans and structures before starting the project, and learn the importance of exchanging work and knowledge through Github and Slack with my team members. In addition, I gained programming skills through practical work and gained confidence that I could solve difficult tasks by performing tasks without giving up with persistence. Lastly, I was encouraged to overcome without worrying about future tasks. It is difficult to perform tasks skillfully from the beginning, but I am confident that I will become a talented person who can perform well at Hana Financial TI if I overcome difficulties with a challenging spirit and passion."
"""Importance of Efforts Learned by Swimming"" Since August 2018, I have been swimming for 1 hour every day from 8 o'clock to maintain a regular life and health. At first, it was quickly exhausting and difficult, but seeing people who are good at swimming made me want to do better. Thus, I was corrected for my swimming posture by the elderly who became close to me in the pool. However, when I couldn't swim well, I looked for related videos and studied them. As a result, it was difficult to complete the 50m-long swimming pool track at first, but I was able to do six laps without stopping. I learned through swimming that I need the 'right mind' and 'strength' to get through something. With the idea of 'When does the end of the track come?' you cannot fully concentrate on swimming, and the end of the track is a new beginning, so you may soon get tired of it. I learned that the mindset when doing a certain task is not waiting for the end, but to immerse yourself in the process. Also, I think what makes it possible is the strength that you have built up so far, namely effort. I lacked muscle strength in both swimming and life. But now, I am working hard to acquire the programming and data management skills necessary for the SW Engineering job every day. Even if I join SK C&C, I will not judge it as the completion of the track and become an employee who develops muscle strength in a new process. I participated in a mentoring program that teaches Korean to foreigners ""to achieve communication without language."" My mentee was a Chinese named 'OOO.' My problem was that he didn't know Korean and English. I also don't know Chinese, so when I told the person in charge that I can't communicate with the mentee, the person in charge can give up, but if I cancel once, I told the Chinese friend that there will be no additional chance to match. After thinking hard, I decided to spend one semester with him. I wanted to be helpful to him who will learn Korean alone in another country. Since then, my friend and I have met twice a week to communicate and teach text using a translator app. My friends who found out that they were teaching Korean to foreigners through a translator said that it was absurd, but it was difficult for me that it took more time than I looked around me. It was because it took more than twice as long to teach, so I had a lot of difficulty in parallel with my studies. I was able to finish the semester safely as a result of trying to continue mentoring while reducing break time and sleep. I was able to learn the weight of responsibility and the power of communication. I learned that if I have to take responsibility for my job, I should communicate voluntarily and actively for problem solving and improvement rather than being scared and giving up. Through the above experience, I will demonstrate my communication skills and community spirit at SK C&C, which pursues shared growth with customers. Completion of the Java application SW developer training course based on algorithm and data structure In order to improve my skills with enthusiasm for programming languages such as Java and Oracle DB, I wrote the class content plan by myself, and I tried to improve my programming skills by investing 3 hours a day consistently outside of the course study hours conducted by the educational institution. After the training, I created OOO service with my team members by devising a project to apply web technologies and CRUD techniques such as Ajax and Spring Framework. Acquisition of Information Processing Technician Certification In parallel with national strategic industry vocational training, I took the first information processing technology test in 2018. Writing was memorized and understood using school hours, and practical skills were able to acquire knowledge of a wide range of submissions by submitting questions using the study and the console of the eclipses. Through this experience, I was able to improve my understanding of new technology trends, algorithms, and DBs, and I was qualified as an information processing technician."
"The challenge is 'to shine when effort is accompanied'. I have the experience of learning that a challenge without effort cannot be successful. In the second half of 2017, I failed in the challenge of finding a job. I judged that the problem was that I did not constantly search to understand the company and job, and that I was not faithful to credit management, which is the duty of college students. Things that I did not try hard came back as a result of being eliminated from the job market. Only then could I learn the simple truth that people who have worked hard and prepared for it can seize opportunities through challenges. ■ Efforts for re-challenge ■ In 2018, I decided to develop my job competency based on failure. Before increasing my expertise, I was able to decide on the goal of 'IT Architect' by analyzing various jobs and asking myself what I wanted to do. For this, I completed an 800-hour SW developer training course for the purpose of improving my expertise, and took the information processing engineer test during training and passed. I was able to achieve good results when I put the plans to achieve the goal of acquiring IT skills into action. By continuously studying, I have achieved the challenge of acquiring a programming language for six months. With the spirit of challenge accompanied by hard work, I will become an engineer who makes small differences in ICT development and operation jobs. ■ Success story ■ In the '****' subject I took in 15, I conducted a project with two men and women I met for the first time. One day, during the meeting, the female member expressed her negative opinion directly on the contents of the male member's investigation, which cooled the mood. I hurriedly settled the issue that had to be decided at the meeting and broke up the meeting. Believing that communication between the members must take place first in order to conclude the project smoothly, I called her separately to talk about the problems and suggested meeting him and apologize to achieve the project's goals. Fortunately, the relationship between the members, which could have gone against the beginning of the project, was restored. As a result, the presentation of the project was able to proceed safely. ■ Failure story ■ I have participated in a project to participate in an overseas tour program in 2014. Fortunately, we were able to get to know each other easily even though it was our first time seeing each other, so the atmosphere of the meeting was very comfortable and we were able to proceed freely. However, the output was not good enough. The topic was not decided until a few days later, and as a result, it was not selected for the program due to insufficient data research and PPT writing. ■ Collaboration should be based on a clear goal ■ It was the most difficult to propose an apology to female members in projects in class, while it was the most difficult to decide on a topic in overseas exploration projects. The projects with high intimacy failed, but I think the reason why we were able to achieve the best results in projects with close intimacy was because of communication on the premise of achieving the goal of collaboration. Rather than forgetting the purpose of collaboration and just enjoying the meeting, I could learn that collaboration can be successful when goal achievement takes precedence over communication. Through the SW knowledge accumulated in IT education and the variable management skills acquired by majoring in industrial management engineering, I can demonstrate my strengths directly or indirectly in the job. While working on a project to develop a homepage during the programming language curriculum, one of the team members suddenly gave up the training with one week left before the presentation. We agreed to re-establish the schedule after the meeting to complete the project. I, who was in charge of scheduling, wrote a flow schedule for page construction and package integration using Gant chart, and through this, I was able to give additional roles to each team. As a result of thoroughly fulfilling each role according to the re-established schedule, it was recognized through the presentation that our team submitted a high-quality project even though there were vacancies. I think my competitiveness is the ability to manage variables, including scheduling ability, along with the IT knowledge that played a part in the development of the project. In addition, the experience of practicing ERP through industrial engineering experiment classes can be helpful in developing and operating related IT systems. This is because developers or managers can show a high understanding of developing related systems when they have actually used SW. I will show my strengths in the job through IT knowledge and industrial management engineering experience. It is an essential vision because the competencies required according to the changing times are SMART and CREATIVE. It is the ability required of us in the face of the 4th Industrial Revolution, where machines replace humans and technological development is taking place at a rapid pace. It cannot be replaced by SMART, artificial intelligence, and deep learning that can quickly adapt and apply new technologies, and Hanwha System ICT can develop with CREATIVE that can only be exercised by humans. I have experience in deciding the theme of the club through the ideas I suggested. In order to solve the problem that the club I visited again after serving in the military turned into an unidentified group, I constantly searched the Internet and searched for books in the library. As a result, I was able to propose an idea derivation technique called brainwriting through a book called 'Exciting Debate'. As a result of conducting the meeting through the relevant discussion method, it was reborn as a 'Team Competition Discovery and Support' club that can satisfy the majority of members by adding a number of ideas. If I had simply suggested an idea for a new topic, I would not have made the best choice necessary for deciding the topic of the club. Through this experience, I learned that a CREATIVE idea can be demonstrated as SMART through constant effort. I will take the lead in the development of the ICT sector of the Hanwha system by demonstrating creativity through constant learning."
"I had a presentation on IT issues when I was a third grader in college. There were various presentations such as IoT, drone, virtual reality, and augmented reality, and I presented them under the theme of FinTech and Insure Tech. While doing research, I learned that many of the latest IT technologies are applied to the financial sector, and I was very attracted to the fact that IT technologies are combined with finance to create something new. In particular, WooriFIS is an ICT company that developed the first mobile messenger in the financial sector, Wibitok, and the first mobile bank in Korea, Wibitank, and obtained three international quality certifications for development, operation, and security. I want to join WooriFIS as a financial IT expert to become the world's No. 1 ICT company. My goal after joining the company is to analyze customers' needs and develop IT services like Wibitok, which has functions that differentiate it from existing chat apps such as 'Pung Message' and 'Message Recovery'. When I was in college, I worked on a project called '3D For Kids'. At that time, I saw an Internet article titled ""The Efficiency of Writing English Word Education"", and I wondered if there was a solution, and based on the augmented reality technology of the app called ""Pokemon Go"", I developed a mobile application that combines augmented reality and English word education. The main functions were word recognition through the camera, 3D image output, inventory that can collect and inquire English words, and card games that use the collection function. Thanks to this, I received the excellent prize at the 'SW Project Performance Presentation'. With these capabilities, I will participate in the advancement of our fiasco into a global financial IT company. ""Confidence gained through perseverance"" When I was a freshman in college, I had a hard time learning C++ programming for the first time. I wondered if I could go along with the class after I was discharged from the military, but I thought of hitting it once, and took a course called programming application and design. However, there was a situation in the middle of the semester that I couldn't touch it due to difficult tasks. Looking at my senior who submitted assignments that felt only difficult, I thought not to repeat my freshman's mistakes. I gradually completed the function by studying SQL, socket communication, and MySQL databases. After two weeks, I submitted the assignment, but the professor gave me a positive view of me, who did not give up and did the assignment until the end. I gained confidence that I could do it, and it was an experience that gave me a great opportunity to improve my programming skills. In the third grade, I took on the role of the team leader while working on a OOO project. The completion of the development you suggested was over 60%, but our group aimed at 90%. However, it took a lot of time to write the specifications and designs, so the development deadline was just around the corner. With the idea of doing my best as a team leader, I studied MySQL, JSP, JavaScript, and MVC models all night through Internet materials and books, and developed my functions first. I completed it by asking questions about the parts I did not know through e-mail to an incumbent web developer, and I was able to develop the functions each of the team members by referring to the functions. Thanks to my persistent efforts, I was able to feel great trust from my team members and the joy of the development project. ""New Trend-Insure Tech"" As the latest IT technologies have been combined with finance, many financial IT services, including voice recognition services using AI, biometric recognition, and non-face-to-face services, have been released. However, the domestic insurance market has not changed much. In the era of the 4th industrial revolution, consumers have become smart as IT experience and knowledge accumulate, and the insurance market is also rapidly changing as various technologies develop. Lemonade, an American insurance startup, uses artificial intelligence technology to provide services that are in charge of insurance claims and recommend consumer personalized products based on big data. In addition, Progressive, an American insurance company, provides a service that reduces insurance costs when driving safely by analyzing customers' driving habits, such as sudden braking, total driving distance, and driving date. Customers think that the market will no longer be a passive role in receiving insurance services, but an active role in reducing the likelihood of accidents, so that insurers and customers can win-win with each other. In addition, if large IT companies such as Amazon invest in InsureTech and enter the insurance industry, I think that basic insurers will also apply IT technologies such as blockchain and big data to their businesses, which will intensify competition among companies. I once worked on a OOOO project when I was in university ""to do the best in each role."" As I was working on the development project for the first time, there were technical difficulties, and the team members remained in school for a long time due to personal reasons, so I couldn't have a team meeting. I thought it was necessary to divide the roles accurately, and through the team meeting, the system to be developed was divided into detailed functions and each part to be in charge of was selected. I developed hypermarket location inquiry, Beacon communication, data DB storage function, and parking location recommendation logic. In addition, we updated the code and development document by using the GitHub shape management tool, and we were able to complete the project within the period. Thanks to the team members' respective roles, we were able to receive the Excellence Papers Award at the Korea Computer Science Conference. I have experience in designing a database of ""constant communication."" Analyzing and designing the materials close to 10 pages of A4 was not easy for all of our team members. We had several team meetings because we thought that if we took the wrong direction in the first stage, a bigger problem might arise later on. However, even if the meeting continued, the opinions of the six people were so different that it was difficult to combine them into one opinion. I thought it was caused by not understanding the theoretical concept accurately, so I suggested that we record the professor's lecture and study again. As I studied the book and lecture again, I corrected the misunderstanding through the meeting.Thanks to this, I was able to receive the highest score among the 12 teams during the first presentation and receive praise from the professor. While taking a leave of absence, I worked as a lecturer at a programming academy. As I was working hard for the first time, I had difficulty teaching children. It was not easy to explain even grammar that could be easily understood at the children's level. I recalled a time when I had difficulty with coding, and studied again from the basics while thinking about what was confusing from the children's point of view. Thanks to this, I was able to proceed with the lecture safely. There will be many shortcomings as a new employee in our FIS. However, with the idea of learning again like this, I will work hard to become a talented person who constantly communicates with my seniors."
"""Electronic dream tree starts with electronic dream tree ends with programmer"" When I was in middle and high school, I preferred math and physics. Among them, I was particularly interested in electricity and electronics, so I went to the electronic engineering department. There, I met C programming for the first time. Among the first-year subjects of the electronic engineering department, except for C programming, there were quite a few things that overlapped with what I learned in high school. As a result, I was able to devote most of my study time to C programming, and I achieved the highest grade in class. I became interested in programming and started studying it in the second grade after I joined the military. I studied C++ and Visual C++ (MFC) in my major, laying the foundation for programming, and experienced programming in various environments such as ATmega and Unix to develop my dream of becoming a programmer. In addition to the required subjects, I developed my personal competence in programming while completing all the elective courses related to programming, and I became more confident, so I was fully in charge of programming for various projects during the semester. However, when I became a senior and experienced more difficult projects and participated in a contest, I felt that I needed experience to develop my overall knowledge and skills in programming in addition to my studies. In the second semester of my fourth year, I took a developer training curriculum at OOOOO in parallel with my studies. There, I was able to learn about various programming languages, embedded systems, and web programming, and I constantly tried to take one step forward by studying separately. Since then, I have been able to complete education at the same time as I graduated from college, and once again, I have strengthened my will to dream of becoming a programmer. ""There is no rough draft in my dictionary."" When I get interested in a specific area, I usually look for everything from one to ten when I look for something, or when I buy something related. As a result, I have never skimmed over when I look for something, so I often become knowledgeable in many ways and inform others. This personality is similar when I study or deal with something. When I'm immersed in one task or problem, I tend to hold onto it until I'm done with it, and while I'm working on that one task, I can concentrate so well that I don't look back on another task. If this applies to my personality and my job as a software developer, I think I can achieve good results for my job. ""Triple A-type boy, become a caring icon."" My weakness is that I think I am an introvert. I was careful to talk to strangers and friends of the opposite sex, so I was able to get out of my head all kinds of simulations about how to do not feel pressured and offended the other person. However, as I entered the school year, I often couldn't talk to people I wanted to get close to or friends I like, and I was so frustrated that I decided to change my personality. After that, I joined the broadcasting department in high school and the student council in college, and constantly tried to change my personality to an extrovert by communicating with many people. As I continued my club activities, my fear disappeared when I first talked to the first person I saw, but strangely, I became more careful about not only words but also actions, and being considerate of the other person became a habit. As a result, I became recognized as a person who knows how to be considerate of others, and after that, I naturally put ""thinking and caring attitude for the other person"" as a lifestyle, and I was able to improve my shortcomings a lot. The reason I chose the job of S/W development among various jobs is that development is more helpful than any other study, and it was very good that the more I did it, the more I gained various perspectives as I gained experience, and the greater the sense of accomplishment I gained as much as I tried. I went to the university with OO engineering, but I studied hard because programming that I encountered for the first time was more interesting than any other subject. As the grade went up, I came across various languages, and my interest in programming grew even more, and naturally my skills improved. As a result, while working on a joint task, I was in charge of writing the source code that other people had difficulty with, and I was able to clearly determine my career path by always taking full charge of the programming part when I made a specific program or was working on a project. After deciding on my career path, I have done competitions, internet lectures, and completion of educational institutions in order to further develop my capabilities. In the second semester of my third year of college, I had a field training at a place called OOOO for two months. My task there was to develop an open-source wearable development kit called HEXIWEAR, which measures heart rate and body temperature to prevent cardiac arrest patients, and to develop an algorithm that automatically alerts the paramedics when a suspected cardiac arrest value occurs. I spent the first month or so interpreting open sources of functions necessary to develop a cardiac arrest patient prevention algorithm, and spent the other month developing actual algorithms. Because HEXIWEAR's open source was a high-level code to interpret in my ability at the time, it was difficult to interpret, and there were difficulties in developing actual algorithms. However, I found these courses interesting and it gave me a chance to work as a developer. I think I can tell you the language I learned while I was in college and the language I learned in an educational institution before graduation. I learned C, C++, and Linux programming in college, and I learned Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an educational institution. Among them, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were learned together when I was doing web programming through the Django module in Python, and I also learned both Jackie and Ajax.In addition, I have experienced MySQL and MongoDB as DBMS, I have used MySQL on both Windows and Linux, on the console on Linux, and as a workbench on Windows. MongoDB was not learned, but I used it separately while working on a project, and I used it in conjunction with Python. Additionally, I have overall knowledge of the network. In college, I took more than two related courses and have an information processor license as a proof material. Also, although I am not related to cloud services, I have used YOLO, a deep learning-based object recognition algorithm. Let me tell you about my experience in the project. 1. C language project experience: - Sensors such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino, module control - Simple console game (Halligali) - Image processing programming using OPENCV Level of thinking by itself: Intermediate 2. C++ Project experience: - Game using MFC (Catchmind) - Image processing programming using OPENCV Level of thinking by itself - Image processing programming using Qt Widget programming Level of thinking by itself: Medium and low 3. Python project experience: - Creating a personal site using the Django framework - HTTP web communication using the Django framework - Interworking with Mongo DB - Intermediate 4. Java project experience: - Android game application (Gugudang) Level of thinking by itself: - Medium and low 5. HTML project experience: - Creating a personal site in conjunction with Python Level of thinking by itself: - Level 6. CSS project experience: - Level of thinking about creating a personal site in conjunction with Python Level of thinking: Level 7. JavaScript project experience: - Use with QML in Qt Quick application & HTTP web communication by itselfYour Excellency's rating: While working on various projects at mid- to low-level universities, I learned that there was a subject related to algorithms and learned that it was important to create code efficiently and to be able to use algorithms. Later, I started studying algorithms with my classmates at an educational institution related to programming that I attended before graduating from college. The main code for learning algorithms was Java, and I studied algorithms for two hours three times a week for three months from September to November. The goal of learning algorithms was not to solve only problems but to develop effective algorithm thinking skills, so I used a method of solving problems, looking at each other's codes, and finding more effective ways through discussion. Since it was more effective to teach others what I learned than to study alone, I explained the parts that I had studied separately and pointed out the wrong parts. Based on what I had studied, I volunteered to explain algorithms or concepts that were a little difficult within the study and to interpret the code, and I also led the atmosphere when the students were struggling in difficult parts. While learning the algorithm, I was able to develop my judgment ability to find the best function for a specific situation, and I also explained it to the study people by giving examples. In addition, while solving algorithm problems, I was able to feel the close relationship between coding and mathematics. For example, it can be easily solved by using repetitions in a code that requires the sum of numbers listed in turn, but the larger the number of numbers, the less efficient it is, so using the sum formula of the equal sequence, the more efficient the time complexity could be achieved. While working on the study, I learned responsibility through my leading role, and gained a passion for studying the algorithm, the desire to experience it in a language other than C and Java rose, and I have since tried to increase my algorithmic ability by encountering various problems through algorithm problem sites. I promise that this accumulated algorithmic ability and thinking ability can be an excellent developer of the S/W development department that requires problem-solving ability and creative problem-solving ability using various programming languages."
"IT in the era of the 4th industrial revolution will break the boundaries of hardware based on high-tech technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, and have a great impact on overall life. In particular, in the fields of aviation, logistics, and finance, where huge amounts of data processing and high level of accuracy are essential, I think how well you use IT technology will act as a factor in determining the leading companies in the industry. I want to be reborn as an IT expert in the future based on my basic knowledge of computer science in general and my experience with various projects including graduation works, which I learned while majoring in computer science. Asiana IDT, which is actively investing in various high-tech fields such as big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence with the aim of becoming No. 1 in the industry, is an excellent company for me to be reborn as an IT expert in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. As we enter the era of the 4th industrial revolution, if high-tech IT technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are applied to aviation fields where accuracy and time compliance are prioritized, it will bring great efficiency to operation. I want to join Asiana IDT and gain experience in high-tech fields in line with the rapidly changing times. By participating in the construction of various advanced solutions, I would like to contribute to Kumho Asiana Group's rebirth as a No. 1 company in aviation and logistics by becoming an expert for 10 years. I applied for the job of system development and operation, and while majoring in computer science, I became interested in the field of system development and operation. Based on the basic knowledge of computer science that has been steadily built up along the curriculum of my major for four years, I have worked hard on algorithms that allow me to process various data and create effective output. Based on the project capabilities and insights on data analysis gained through this experience, I think that if I join Asiana IDT, I will be able to participate in various system development and operation. When I was an undergraduate, I was able to build and operate a website as a final project while taking the Web System Design course, and I planned a website for people who raise pets after a long discussion with my team members with the goal of realizing a really useful website beyond simple tasks. I felt that I was very short on time to proceed with the project while working at school because I included various services for usefulness. However, rather than reducing the function, I was able to complete the project smoothly as a result of adjusting the schedule with the team members, sharing the development with my own parts, and reinforcing the knowledge through active research on the necessary parts. When I was taking a subject called Critical Thinking and Discussion, I was able to discuss the pros and cons of the future of artificial intelligence. At that time, all the members of the group who were preparing for the discussion were majoring in the humanities and social sciences, so they had difficulty understanding the principles and characteristics of artificial intelligence. However, since it was the time when the final exam was in full swing, there was a limit to studying the concept of artificial intelligence. Since childhood, I have kept in mind the belief that I should study and leave others, and I have produced materials using my major knowledge to share with the team members. Thanks to this, I was able to split my time and use it to prepare for the final exams in other subjects, but the experience of using my knowledge to help others remains impressive."
"""School Award: Teaching, Learning, and Growing Together"" When I was a second grader, I had experience building a school in Laos with the architectural experience I learned during my military service. During my military service, I worked at various architectural sites such as recovering from typhoon damage and creating parks. While performing this task, I felt proud that my skills could be helpful to society, and I set a goal to practice them in society as well. Even after being discharged from the military, I periodically engaged in architectural service, and in 2014, I was able to perform architectural service in Laos. In addition, I was able to serve as a mentor for juniors while working as an assistant in my major class. Through these experiences, I was able to share learning and compensate for my shortcomings. I think I can exert my true value when I can share learning and contribute to society. I also want to actively learn from SK Chemicals and contribute to the team, company, and society. ""Field experience + Knowledge = Improvement"" I would like to be in charge of improving the production system based on my understanding of SCM in IT planning team. To this end, I have gained production field experience, production plan, and SCM-based knowledge. First, it is field experience. I was able to improve my understanding of ERP and the site while carrying out the shipment management work at the factory. For the final shipment, I managed the processes of each department, from manufacturing instructions to raw material purchase requests to post-production test requests, and in this process, I was able to think about how to establish an optimal production system. Second, I deepened my understanding of SCM by obtaining a CPIM certificate in addition to my major subjects. In this process, I learned the production process from establishing a production plan to MRP for ordering materials and requesting purchase. In addition, I was able to understand the flow of resources inside and outside the organization by approaching the demand forecast to purchase strategy in a large framework, and I was able to develop an eye for production from the perspective of the company as a whole. In addition, I was able to think about the terms and inventory management techniques used in practice. Based on this, I promise to set the goal of 'improving SK Chemical's production system and shortening lead time' and achieve it. I have the experience of obtaining a certificate in the third test after challenging the excavator driver's certificate ""The infinite possibility learned through excavator."" While working as a facility manager during my military life, I went to various work sites, and I challenged for a certificate because I felt the utility of an excavator. With no driving experience, I was rejected in two consecutive tests due to my poor equipment manipulation. To overcome this, I first looked back on what I lacked. At the center of it was a complacent thought that ""because my colleagues around me easily acquire it."" In addition, I was able to realize that I was inexperienced in lever manipulation during work. To compensate for this, I asked the driver for help, went to work 30 minutes early every day, and practiced together while leaving work late. In addition, with the mindset of 'I can do it', I recorded and supplemented my shortcomings every day, and as a result, I was able to pass the third test. I have accurately grasped my current skills, and I think I was able to pass as a result of supplementing them. Through this experience, I gained confidence that I can do anything with a goal and tenacity. I will show you that SK Chemicals does not give up and does my job until the end."
"I want to challenge and develop with Hanwha, which is making a leap into a global company. I read an article that ranked 23rd in the 'Global Defense Company' rankings compiled by the U.S. defense industry magazine last year. I believe that Hanwha System is playing a key role in the center of Hanwha's defense sector, which has shown itself to be the best defense company not only in Korea but also in Asia. Hanwha Systems produces defense products based on IT and has cutting-edge technologies in the fields of command and control systems, electronic optical equipment, and aviation systems. I want to develop advanced weapons systems by utilizing the technology of the 4th Industrial Revolution and contribute to the export of defense systems together. I completed an engineering certification program and gained basic competencies as a software engineer. And the IT knowledge gained through several project experiences while in school and the ability to communicate and collaborate with team members will contribute to Hanwha's growth as a global company. I have worked on projects under the theme of 'The foundation of all systems is a network' and 'Development of safety applications between BLE-based bicycles and pedestrians'. I studied how to increase the beacon transmission success rate according to various communication situations, and wrote a paper on the technique of measuring link quality and controlling the beacon transmission cycle through channel congestion. During the project, I learned a lot of network communication knowledge by consulting with the school network laboratory about the obstruction. I think the network is the one that does not fall into any of the fields of ground power, marine system, or aviation industry. Based on my network knowledge, I would like to participate in the development of the next-generation tactical communication system together. I took the ""System Development through Clear Design Process"" and ""Software Design"" to learn how development proceeds from the initial stage of system development to completion as a developer. I worked on a project to analyze system requirements, analyze validity, and prepare requirements. I learned the systematic process of system design by creating a class diagram for object-oriented modeling, and a sequence diagram to understand the dependence relationship between implementation modules. I learned that system development becomes easier after a clear design process. In addition, the system can be developed in C, C++, and Java languages, and various coding abilities such as computer structure, operating system, and system programming have been developed. The project was carried out under the theme of 'Development of BLE-based Safety Applications between Bicycles and Pedestrians' in the course of Comprehensive Design Project 1. We decided to create a beacon transmitter that sends beacon signals that include information such as the current location and speed of the bicycle, and an application that calculates the risk and informs the user. Our team thought that the completion of the project would be enhanced by the ability to transmit the current status information of the bicycle in a beacon and adjust the beacon transmission cycle according to various situations. To control the transmission cycle, we developed the board of the Nordic Semiconductor Company. We decided to adjust the transmission cycle to minimize beacon collisions when multiple bicycles transmit beacon devices at the same time. However, the Nordic board had few users, making it difficult to find the information we wanted on the Internet. We thought about implementing only the current status information transmission function of the bicycle, but we did not give up and tried to solve the problem. We first read the basic user guidebook provided by Nordic companies. And we revised all the example codes related to BLE to understand the codes. We answered the questions by posting them on the Nordic Developer Forum site. We were able to complete the project by varying the beacon transmission cycle depending on the current speed of the bicycle. I realized that if I challenge without giving up even when I am lacking in information, I can achieve my goal, and I have confidence that I can solve any adversity I face. With this confidence, I will become a Hanwha person who does not give up and works patiently."
"""A company that is changing after reading the trends of the times"" I saw an article that CJ Group is converting all IT systems of major affiliates to the cloud for stable IT system operation. Seeing how CJ Group has been able to provide the highest level of service that customers want in various fields so far, by catching up with and responding to the changing trends of the world, I have learned how CJ Group has been able to provide the best service in various fields. I want to become an engineer who responds sensitively to the changes of the times and responds quickly to the latest IT trends and grows by joining a changing company like this. ""Experience until just before system development"" In the second semester of my second year, I took the ""Software Design"" course and learned how to design a software system using UML. And I proceeded with a project to carry out system design based on what I learned. I had the experience of writing a work plan through system requirements, feasibility analysis, requirements definition, etc. by choosing a topic. In the meantime, the major class taught me the knowledge that a developer should have, but this course clearly taught me the process of development. This experience made me interested in system development and applied for the job of system development/operation. In order to perform the ""SW expertise and communication ability"" system development/operation job, I think SW expertise is essential first. As a computer major, I have acquired software development languages such as c, c++, and Java. And I gained IT knowledge through major classes such as software design and operating system. Next, I think I need communication skills to communicate with various people in charge of various tasks. I applied for a volunteer group for the free semester system for college students and taught classes for middle school students. We conducted a survey of each class to attract students' interests, and accepted the request about the class method and class schedule of the teacher in charge of our volunteer group, and obtained advice from the teacher. Through this volunteer activity, I have developed my ability to communicate in various relationships. After joining the CJ Olive Networks IT business department, I want to be reborn as an IT expert who understands not only IT technology but also CJ Group as a whole. To do this, I first have to become an expert in system development, which is my job. I think the core of system development is analysis power. This is because we need to accurately analyze what kind of system our customers want to develop a system that meets their needs. And I think we need to have the ability to quickly adapt to the new environment. Because I understand that the system development job is put into another department related to CJ's business area as a project unit to perform the work. When a new project is put into it, the development environment, work process, or project member often changes, so we need to make efforts to adapt to the new environment easily and quickly. At this time, it is important to quickly adapt to the new environment, but it is also important to quickly understand the work in an unfamiliar field. This is because I think that the department can accurately develop the system it wants only when it understands the work of the department that has been put in. I think it is impossible to study a new field in a new work environment for each project without the spirit of challenge and passion for work. New challenges can be difficult. However, as you work on various projects, you can meet more experts in various fields and learn business in various fields through communication with them. If I become an expert in system development like this, I think I will naturally be able to understand CJ Group's overall work in various business areas. I will become an IT expert who follows trends by continuously paying attention to new technology trends while learning not only IT technology but also other fields of business."
"When I was in college, I worked on a website creation project with three colleagues and I while receiving support from a club. Halfway through the project, my colleague was late for a meeting or began to pass on his work to other team members. The team members started to struggle as the workload increased, and their progress was slowed down. I called my coworker separately and told him why he did it. My coworker said he did it because other projects weren't far off and I thought I could give him some convenience. By reminding me once again of the team's goal of completing the homepage construction on time, I solidified my roles and responsibilities within the team. Also, after explaining what kind of damage my actions have caused the team and what kind of consequences they will have, I decided to explain my motivations at the team meeting and help someone who could afford to do the work. As a result, I was able to successfully complete my motivations and our team's projects on time. When I was a ""network firefighter"" undergraduate, I was assigned to build a network and communicate with the team project by applying routing protocols. Using Ubuntu and Vyos, we installed several servers and routers, including Mail and DNS, and implemented Static, BGP, and OSPF protocols to build a network. I could have done only the assignments given with my team members and submitted them, but in fact, the network is not always stable, such as DDoS attacks, disconnection, and troubleshooting, so I persuaded other team members to generate and solve obstacles that could occur realistically. In addition, we have established a more secure communication network by applying network security such as IPS, IDS, IPSec, and web firewalls so that no one else can check the contents of communication. After the project was completed, the professor said that it had been implemented well in addition to the instructions, and selected it as an excellent project and presented it in front of others. It was a difficult situation to show an uncooperative attitude, such as ""six team members all A+"" team members not attending the meeting or not performing their assignments. For me, who had little experience as a leader at the time, the role of the leader was burdensome, and there was an opinion that I should exclude the team members. However, I couldn't drop out without trying the same group of friends. First, I kept trying to communicate. I asked other team members for their understanding and recommended and persuaded them to do something simple and easy. At first, a friend who only ignored the contact started to participate with my persistence and consideration from the team members, and at the end, we were able to finish the presentation together. Efforts to achieve the overall performance naturally appeared as individual performance, which was an opportunity to learn true teamwork. While preparing for the thesis competition in the club, I was scolded for the incorrectly written interim presentation report. After writing and testing the code myself, the data was recorded randomly because the team member could not write the code. I said sorry and had a meeting with him. I thought about how to solve the problem as soon as possible. After grasping the problems and remaining deadlines, we all agonized over the wrong data, wrote the code, and modified the data according to the form. We created a rule to write and share the reports we each wrote on the bulletin board every week, but if a problem or question arises, we will share it with our team members immediately. Since there is not much time left until the deadline, everyone remained until late, so we studied more and reviewed the materials we shared on the weekend. The completed report was integrated and organized to receive feedback from the professor. With these efforts, I submitted the final report on time and received the excellence award."
"""Professionality, Communication, Innovation Orientation"" Lack of expertise in IT causes more damage due to lack of ability to cope with accidents. Lack of communication makes it impossible to collaborate with work, and if there is no innovation, it is pushed back. In order to develop expertise and innovation, the club won the Excellence Award at the end of the year by conducting projects and seminars on major knowledge and new technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence every week. In order to develop communication skills, I have attended weekly reading discussion meetings to discuss books I have read with members. By having discussions with members, I was able to cultivate the ability to accept and acknowledge various opinions and to present them logically without being nervous in front of a large number of people. During the Unix programming class, there was a project to create a small Linux by forming a team. The program's window size was developed by continuously discussing how users could use it comfortably, such as what ratio to see, what color to use, and how to display the icons they wanted to emphasize. In addition, we created an evaluation table and asked 20 acquaintances to test the program to receive opinions on what to improve and what to add. In the final presentation, I scored high in user convenience and design, ranking third out of nine teams. The team leader was able to learn that although the abilities and knowledge of the team members are different, they should support and give trust to bring out the maximum capabilities in the areas they are good at. When I was a researcher, hard cleaning was dedicated to the youngest, and there were also three to four weekly interviews with professors and Saturday attendance rules during vacation. Seniors said that it was to see the hierarchy and integrity of the lab, but on Saturday, they only checked their attendance by phone, so there were complaints from juniors. Therefore, on the day of weekly reporting to seniors, I suggested that the cleaning should be done in pairs, and that the interview with the professor should be reduced to two times a week, but the report should be submitted as an assignment. In order to persuade them, we voluntarily sought work, and continuously submitted additional reports as a result of our efforts with our juniors and coordinated the rules by attending half a day on Saturdays. Since then, seniors have faithfully attended on Saturdays, and by cleaning in pairs, communication between seniors and juniors has increased, thereby increasing the efficiency of work. ""Living a Responsible Life"" It is my values that always carry out my duties responsibly. These values enable quick resolution of problems when they arise. At work, we collaborate on many tasks and promote new ones. When a problem arises while pursuing a job, if the person in charge is not responsible, the problem will be either taken off or the responsibility will be passed on, which will cause more damage. The damage is passed on to the company or customers who want to use its services, and as time goes on to recover, other tasks are not allowed to proceed. Therefore, I think that in order to have a smooth working life, it is most important to perform the job responsibly."
"""IT system that I have no choice but to use."" I dream of talented people who go on without stopping. This is because I think that the moment I am complacent at my level, I will be eliminated. I applied because I thought that KD DS was the best company to achieve this dream. KT DS is currently running a voluntary learning organization called Windmill. It is a system that employees themselves work hard and support to strengthen their capabilities in IT technology and business and lead the market. I thought this system was the best environment to achieve my dream. The goal that I want to achieve after joining the company is to develop an IT system that customers have no choice but to use, not because they want to. What I mean is that I have no choice but to create and use an IT system that maximizes convenience. To this end, I will achieve the following goals. First, after joining the company, I will quickly adapt to KT DS. I will create an environment in which I can maximize my capabilities by forming a bond with my employees. Second, I will strengthen my capabilities through my work and identify customer needs. I will identify functions that I develop frequently and lay the groundwork for the development of customized IT systems. Third, we will develop a customized IT system based on the identified needs. Through this development, we will maximize customer convenience. KT DS will continue to move forward without stopping, and we will develop an IT system that we have no choice but to use rather than because we want to use it while achieving our goals one by one to bring customer satisfaction. I once planned a flea market during the festival to raise funds for overseas volunteer work to ""achieve sold-out."" The goal was to raise funds, so I needed items that could benefit greatly from a small budget. I recommended the material because I thought that the thread bracelet, which is all about the thread, could bring a lot of profit on a small budget, and I set a goal of selling out because I was in charge of it. Contrary to expectations that sales would be good because the price was not high, the sales rate was low. Measures were needed to solve the problem. So, we gathered our team members and decided to make promotional flyers. I tried to attract people's attention by talking about wearing a thread bracelet and the story that a wish comes true while using it. The next day, I went around the school and handed out flyers. As a result, the sales rate increased, but it was difficult to sell out as it is. I thought of a way to promote flyers effectively, and I thought that it would be more effective to do intensive promotions at a place leading to the central library and student cafeteria, which are frequently used by students, rather than going around and promoting them. In the end, all sales were completed on the last day through this method. As a person in charge, I tried harder than others, and I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment due to successful results. Through this experience, I learned that if effort is added to your passion, it will come out as a result. I will contribute to the development of KT DS through passionate efforts at KT DS. ""Completing the App through Collaboration"" I participated in the development of the app in the ""Smart Door Lock Using BLE Beacons"" project in connection with OOO Systems. The project divided the roles into App, Arduino, Server, and DB, and I was in charge of the app. I had to study how to use the beacon first. It was because I had never used it before, so I had difficulty getting beacon information from the app. To this end, I learned how to implement it by analyzing open sources related to beacons. After that, I was able to actually apply the code, continuously modify the code appropriately, and import beacon information. Through this, we were able to implement the door lock unlock function according to the distance from the beacon and complete an app that allows users to easily control the door lock. The app I was in charge of was the most important part of the project, so I spent a lot of time working hard to create a high-quality app. There were some difficulties in the process of thinking about and implementing the function of the app, but I was able to solve them by not giving up and looking for similar open sources and applying them directly through analysis. During the project, I had to undergo continuous inspection by the company and was under pressure to complete it in time, but I was able to have persistence and responsibility in the process. Also, I was able to feel a sense of cooperation by seeing the team members who worked hard to achieve a common goal. Based on this experience, I will do my best in my duties at KT DS, and at the same time, I will try to collaborate with my team members to show successful results. ""Problem-solving, Customer Identification"" I think what is necessary to perform the SW job is the problem-solving ability and the ability to identify customers. It is because problem-solving ability through thinking is basically required for work, and development through customer identification brings customer satisfaction. I strengthened my capabilities through the following efforts. First, I studied algorithms to develop problem-solving ability. After studying basic theory, I developed application ability through online algorithm problem-solving sites. After that, I studied by comparing the differences by looking at other people's codes. In addition, I continued to strive to strengthen my capabilities by completing 40 hours of special lecture on algorithms for college students. Second, I increased my satisfaction by practicing learning through failure. I planned an overseas volunteer calligraphy program. I planned it with the aim of experiencing Korean culture, but I experienced failure because I could not grasp that children prefer activities that move their bodies a lot. Through this, I learned that it is important to identify customers first. Based on this learning, while conducting software education for middle school students, I tried to identify students by giving one-on-one explanations for those who feel difficult in class content. After the explanation, I identified the needs of the students by asking if there was anything else I wanted to know. Through this process, I was able to gradually create the class that the students wanted and improve their satisfaction.Based on what we have learned from our experience, KT DS will solve the problem based on customer identification to bring customer satisfaction."
"""Harmony of Security and Simplicity"" IT technology is at the center of the rapidly changing world right now. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future direction depends on the hands of those dealing with these IT technologies, and its importance is growing. Samsung SDS, which provides strong security and simple services based on IT technology, is also a company that I will be with in the future. To follow this step, I conducted a 'Book Recommendation Project Using Data Analysis' as my graduation work to consider the importance of data and ways to improve the simplicity of real life. The important point of the project was to strengthen security and make it easier to use the desired books in order to store the data of the users who use the service. To build this, the ARIA encryption algorithm, which can be used in various environments, was used to enhance security, and the desired book type was recommended by analyzing the user's data. As a result, I received the evaluation that it was a service that solved the user's concerns and achieved the silver award at the graduation work academic festival. I believe that as technology advances, the importance of protecting personal information and improving user convenience will increase. Based on my previous experience, I would like to become a member of Samsung SDS and build a solution that catches two rabbits, security and convenience like Wearable EMM and Nexsign. ""Goals Set and Action"" I made an effort to set goals clearly and to acquire the ability to implement them. In college, I majored in computer engineering and built up various IT knowledge, and set my goal of ""developing innovative services in line with the rapidly developing IT era."" Based on this goal setting, the following projects were implemented to improve service development capabilities. First, I participated in the 2018 Fall Korean OOOO Association College Student Competition. I had a goal that I wanted to challenge myself in a new field, and based on the embedded programming class I took in the first semester of the 4th year, I developed 'Indoor Location and Path Estimation App Service' based on Beacon, a mobile service based on Beacon IOT. Since it was my first attempt at this field, it was difficult to design and implement. In particular, an error of about 10m occurred in the part of estimating the user's location using the beacon's RSSI signal strength. In order to solve this problem, the evidence was established through books, papers, and the Internet, and we found that the error can be reduced to about 2m if pedestrian speculative navigation (PDR) is used as a gyro (direction) sensor inherent in smartphones. As a result, I was able to develop my ability to establish a basis for the problems I faced in order to achieve my new goal based on objective and reliable data. Second, from May to June in the first semester of the 4th grade, we participated in an idea contest using public data of the marine and fishery with the aim of providing convenient services to someone by utilizing the IT knowledge we learned at university. There was a difficulty in converging numerous data because it was the creation of ideas using public data. In order to solve this problem, a survey on 'convenience and requirements' was conducted on about 20 department professors and students living near the coast, and three important data were derived. Finally, the illegal fishing boat notification app service was planned by converging the fishbowl information, ship operation information, and TAC operation information data obtained from the survey and the contents on the eradication of illegal fishing boats, which were controversial at the time. A software engineer is a person who presents and applies solutions by quantifying and subdividing specific problems. In other words, I thought that goal setting and implementation should be the basis for challenging new fields and thinking to provide convenient services to users, so I tried to put them into practice. In the modern society, personal information leakage accidents are becoming an issue as processing of personal information rapidly increases due to the development of ICT and the spread of the Internet. According to the Korea Internet & Security Agency, personal information leakage accidents more than doubled in 2018 compared to 2017. The leakage of personal information is having a great influence on corporate economic factors and images. In particular, the leakage of personal information through ransomware is causing additional damage. Ransomware is evolving into a customized attack that reflects the specificity of society and culture, such as year-end settlement and internal guidelines, making it more difficult to respond. In recent years, it is expanding in all directions to individuals, companies, and countries. In addition, it is believed that it will penetrate our daily lives, from attacks on the financial and medical sectors that have sensitive data to recent threats to national infrastructure and IoT. I think the following efforts are needed to prevent such ransomware. First, it is the e-mail attachment detection function. It is judged that the detection function is necessary not only for the .exe extension detection used by existing hackers, but also for various document files such as .word.hwp. Second, it is a frequent update. Since we attack through security vulnerabilities, I think we need to supplement the vulnerabilities with frequent software updates. Based on these two efforts, we will be able to provide improved protection against the developing attacks of hackers, and it will also have a positive impact on business competitiveness and economic benefits."
"I think the important thing in the 4th Industrial Revolution is to create new values based on data. I thought Lotte would provide differentiated services unique to customers in a rapidly changing society based on the experiences and know-how gained in various industries. I applied because I want to grow into a SW expert at Lotte, which is expected to grow further. I studied and practiced databases, big data, and AI, which I felt were insufficient while completing my major course, through the ""Deep Learning and Machine Learning-based Data Analyzer Training Course."" Since then, I have developed my expertise by conducting web and app projects. I have also gained practical experience through two internships. Based on these capabilities, I want to grow into an expert who leads new technologies at Lotte. ""Developer of Philosophy"" I feel a great sense of accomplishment in enjoying the process of constantly thinking and gaining results or enlightenment through it. So, my favorite subject in high school was philosophy. The great attraction was that philosophy books do not make sense at once and that there can be various approaches. It was a liberal arts department, and there was a class that greatly influenced me when I was a senior in high school. In my third year of high school, my math teacher told me that I must go to college and take a programming class with an explanation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I couldn't understand it at the time, but I realized the meaning after encountering various news and articles. I thought that understanding IT, which has a huge impact on the entire industry, was essential in a new era. Furthermore, I decided that I could lead a new era if I had IT-related expertise. Afterwards, I boldly applied for cross-subsidized and entered OOO Information and Communication University. After entering the school, I focused on my poor math and programming classes. While taking the programming class, I found that it fits well with my aptitude. I thought that the process of thinking about how to make a more efficient program and finding the cause of the error was similar to the process of philosophy. I enjoyed the process of finding the cause of the error by debugging in assignments and practice, and I felt great pleasure when the program was successfully driven. From this time on, I dreamed of becoming a developer and improved my expertise through major classes and state-funded programs. ""Achieving 30 Orders A Day"" For two months, I have experienced an internship at OOOO located in OO. OOOO is a distributor that imports Korean fashion, beauty, and miscellaneous goods products and sells them in shopping malls and open markets in Japan. My task was to register, deliver, and handle customer response to Amazon Japan seller's account, which had been neglected. First of all, I reviewed the product sales page from the customer's point of view to find out why the order was not coming in. I found a problem that the introduction of the previously sold product was short and the letters were small, making it difficult to see. In order to solve this problem, I created a product introduction image to increase the readability of the product sales page. After that, I practiced explaining the product description being sold in Japanese. Although I am not selling it in person, I thought that selling without understanding the product could be a problem in customer response in the future. At first, I made a mistake in entering the address and managing the order. I responded to customer inquiries about the delay in delivery, asking for advice from the employees. However, the number of orders, which was about 5 at the time I joined the company, reached 30 a day in two months. I became busier as the number of orders increased, but I worked passionately. The most pleasing thing was the five stars and reviews left by customers after purchasing the product. One line of reviews saying that the product is good and delivery is fast came as a huge achievement to me. I proceeded with a web production project in the ""Detailed Personality"" web system design class. Five people formed a team and created 'Connect PnP', a site for opening a meeting. Since the project was a month long, it was important to manage the schedule and minimize problems. By showing my meticulous personality, which is my strength, I promised to subdivide the work to be done on a weekly basis by creating a schedule and check the progress every week. We coordinated each other's schedules and had time to meet every Tuesday evening to share each other's progress and discuss problems. My weakness was that when I was focused, I could not care about the surroundings and moved forward by myself. However, through weekly meetings, I was able to learn how to cooperate with the progress of the group members. In the process of division of roles, I was in charge of designing the main page, membership page, administrator page, membership/login function using Kakao API, and pop-up review function. Since it was a site where users opened and participated in meetings, functions related to membership could be implemented only when the membership function was implemented, so the quick development of the membership part was required to meet the set deadline. I had previous experience using Kakao API, so I volunteered and successfully implemented it using the session. As I implemented the UI, I was recognized for my skills among the team members, so I took charge of the final UI inspection. There was no problem with the web function, but I didn't have time, so I fixed the design that was implemented differently from the one I targeted. I checked and fixed the UI with a meticulous nature that didn't miss even a small part to improve the completeness of the project. ""Developer Leading Change"" My goal in 10 years is to become a SW expert who can pioneer and plan new business myself. 5G network, big data, and AI technologies are currently reversing the processes of many industries. In the future, new changes related to new technologies will be created accordingly. Based on my understanding of customers, I will provide a differentiated system using new technologies. We will also detect industrial changes caused by new technologies and create new businesses there. Furthermore, we will lead the change of new technologies based on the SW expertise acquired by Lotte after joining the company.To this end, after joining the company, I will be interested in the customer's industry and processes and always think about what kind of innovation I can bring about with IT technology. In addition, I will always be interested in IT trends and continue my self-improvement as a developer."
"This happened when I was working as an intern. After recruiting students to study abroad, my boss one day told me, ""I have to check the number of students who will be on the bus on the weekend, and there are no workers. It's not mandatory, but I need your help."" On my part, there was a problem with the weekend time being shortened, and I had to leave early before 8 a.m. However, since it was an important school-related event and other employees were away from work, I was willing to respond because if I didn't go, it could cause a setback. Later, I came out early, checked the student list given by my boss, checked that everyone was there, sent them to the bus, and contacted my boss to report that all were on the bus without any problems. It was after I was selected by the school as an overseas tour group in my college days. The main goal was to present my general impressions of the country I traveled to in ppt, photos, and videos, but my team was in charge of filming the videos. I knew how to film the videos, but I wanted to know how to leave a more impression on the judges, so I asked the team members. Fortunately, since the team leader studied filming in college, I listened to various advice and studied shooting practice and simple editing methods. I also partially participated in ppt production, taking advantage of my previous experience in design without receiving help. Thanks to this, the work went smoothly, and as a result of organizing it in between during the trip, I was able to complete the report within 3 to 4 days, which took about a week shorter than expected, and I received the grand prize in the final evaluation as I was evaluated as flawless in ppt, video, or perfect. As I was working on this project, I realized that what I felt more than awards or travel was the cooperation between team members. In my fourth year of college, I created a game as a graduation project. With the goal of creating a stage with a beginning and an end, we decided to use all kinds of knowledge to proceed together within 3 months. However, a problem occurred during production, and one of the group members was employed and did not have many opportunities to participate, and I was confused about how to use the knowledge I had learned to create the game. As a team leader at the time, I thought that the top priority was to unite the team members, and we gathered all of the team members and had a meeting to resolve this conflict. We also found and coordinated time zones where all of the team members could participate through the meeting, studied game production while finding ways to create a game, met and developed the game for the remaining three days, and if there was anything we didn't know, we put our heads together to solve it. Thus, we were able to submit our results in time for three months and achieve our goal [to create a stage]. Through this experience, I realized that I needed to come up with better results by solving problems through communication and collaboration with others."
"As part of my employment activities, I made ceaseless efforts to enhance my computer knowledge by studying for my major and obtaining a certificate. What I realized while taking major-related courses in university was as follows. * While learning logical circuits, I came to know the concepts of logical computation and digital circuits. * While learning the data structure, I realized how to express data structurally. * While learning algorithms, I was able to devise procedures for problem solving and various approaches. This later affected my acquisition of certification. * While learning the operating system, I was able to grasp the detailed concepts about computer OS that we commonly use. * Through the computer structure, I understood the functions and interactions of the components that make up a computer. In this way, I was able to obtain comprehensive credits for these subjects and obtain an information processing engineer in order to realize more than the knowledge I learned in school. Thanks to this, I was able to reach my goal quickly and accurately by applying these knowledge to minimize problems while working on the graduation project. I am sure that my experience will be helpful to KEPCO KDN. The main task of KEPCO KDN (hereinafter referred to as kdn) is to 'manufacture and manage overall computer systems of KEPCO and its affiliates'. For the efficient power control and management of KEPCO, a parent company, the role of kdn in charge of websites and related software is important. Reflecting this role of kdn, I think I can contribute to the computer management of kdn, which is the reason why I think that the overall understanding of the computer system is faster than other non-acquirers, and I think it is suitable for managing this power management without errors due to my professional nature, which handles everything carefully, and carefully. In addition, I have a design sense as I ran a blog on the subject of my work in college, and I can contribute to the visual convenience that is important for managing web pages and the intuition of interfaces. No matter how much I have the ability to create a complete website with only web programming languages and text coding tools, lack of design aesthetic sense and visual placement skills will make users uncomfortable when searching the website. I was working on my graduation project. There were originally a total of three members in my team, including two members of the team, but the problem was that one of the team members was employed. Instead of appearing on the midterm presentation or important interviews with professors, he did not want to take on important roles such as programming or design, and instead passed on to me as the team leader. One of the other team members was also negligent, trying to pass on all the tasks to me on the pretext that he had learned nothing. So I ran into two difficulties, wondering whether to persuade them to share the roles and go with them to the end or to withdraw the team members. It was uncertain whether the team members who had no will would be able to accomplish the task properly if they continued, and on the contrary, if they withdrew the team members, they might be deducted from the group cooperative score. So I consulted the professor about this, called the team members, talked about it, and then withdrew the students who had already been employed, and asked the remaining one to find what he could do and participate in the project. Fortunately, that judgment helped to flow smoothly and I was able to accomplish it safely. In addition to obtaining a certificate and studying hard in the department, I wanted to create a web page using my design sense after graduation. However, I had never received any training on web programming, but just in the meantime, I heard that there was a state-funded education for Java web programming through my school, and I received training for about five months to develop my skills. The main curriculum was to create a basic web page framework using Java language, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, and to connect a database here to create a basic guest book website. While taking intensive classes in the classroom for seven hours a day, I repeatedly learned the parts that I did not remember after class and personally created a web page for practice, enhancing my understanding by making it my own. And after the whole curriculum was over, I was able to learn about the composition and production process of web pages by creating a visitor's book website as a practice, and as a result, I was able to create basic web pages. I think this ability can contribute in terms of the creation and management of the web page within the kDN. Ethical consciousness at work is an important factor in ensuring that there is no damage in the corporate and social aspects. This sense of ethics is particularly prominent in public institutions that are closely related to the state. In my opinion, the members of the ethical consciousness are the employees within the institution, and these are the faces of the state. This is because every aspect of their facial expressions, tone, actions, etc. are shown to customers every day. Whenever we encounter them, we see them, judge the image of the government and the country indirectly, and I believe we trust the government accordingly. In other words, I think that their office work ability, service to customers, and even between individual employees are clearly linked to public trust. This lack of ethical consciousness follows just from the occasional irregularities within state agencies that have appeared in the news. People are concerned that such news will reduce their trust in the state and further distrust the state and the government. Therefore, before these things happen, employees of public institutions should act carefully anytime, anywhere, with the mindset that they truly serve as examples for the people. Above all, an attitude to clarify public affairs is the top priority for employees of public institutions."
"I applied because I wanted to help new students set goals that they could do. When I join the company, I will work in the attitude of learning from scratch no matter where the department I am assigned to in the early stages. Above all, I will listen to the advice of a senior who has more work experience than me first, and if I don't know, I will not be shy about asking. Furthermore, I will organize things I don't know in a notebook, and as the field I applied is computerized, I won't forget to study related things separately after work. It is cooperation and communication. When I was working on a graduation project at school, there was a block in the middle. Most of the team members lacked knowledge, so it was not enough to do it alone, but when they put their heads together, it went easier than before. Once, I did not have enough documents while performing my duties, and I was able to tell the team member about this, and then contact another team who was scheduled to be on a business trip in the same area. If I hadn't told the team member this first at this time, I would have had a big problem, if not, getting in trouble with my work. I obtained an article to improve my major. Among the subjects I learned in my third year of college, there were <Logic Circuit> and <Operating System>, and these subjects helped me a lot in obtaining certification. In addition to college class, there was a time when I made my own bulletin board while taking a web programming class at an academy after graduation, and I thought that the more I learned, the better my skills will be, so I came home to review what I learned that day. And I registered on an online coding site to solve algorithm problems and not forget my sense of major field. I worked on a project when I was in my fourth year of college. If it was a problem, one of the team members got a job and didn't have many opportunities to participate, and I was confused about how to use the knowledge I had learned so far in production. As the team leader at the time, I first gathered my team members and had a meeting. Through the meeting, we arranged the time when all the team members could participate, and the project proceeded by studying two days a week, meeting three days a week, and meeting with them three days to solve problems by asking each other if there was anything they didn't know. As a result, we were able to complete the results according to the target period of 3 months, and I realized that better results could be produced by solving problems through cooperation with others. Ethics is an important factor in ensuring that there is no damage in the corporate/social aspects of work. What constitutes this ethics is the employees in the school, and I think these are the faces of the school. This is because their facial expressions, tone, behavior, etc. are shown to students. Therefore, I think first of all, employees should be more honest with others. In my previous job, the deputy director often mentioned it, and if you hide something without being honest, it will not only cause a big problem in proceeding with the work, but it can also undermine the trust of the school, not only the person who lied."
"""Passion for Financial IT"" While working as a part-timer at a bank as a security guard, the bank responded to various clients' requests. Among them, the most common request was how to use IT services, such as Internet banking. This is because the complicated process of using Internet banking was a huge barrier for customers who were not familiar with using IT devices. Through this experience, I became interested in financial IT, hoping that I could provide financial IT to users more conveniently. Tiscis has secured high competitiveness in the comprehensive financial market by successfully performing ITO for various financial companies as well as projects within the Heungkuk Financial Family. In this regard, Tiscis applied because it thought that it was the best stage to do financial IT that I wanted. ""Passion for Learning"" I think a developer is a lifelong learning job. This is because I have to adapt to the IT environment that develops day by day. And I have a passion for learning. I have tried to become a developer who constantly learns through mentoring financial IT experts and the Java Front-End developer process. ""Various Development Experience"" Based on various development experiences, we have laid the foundation for the successful performance of IT service development and maintenance duties at Tsis. Through the Hanyum ICT mentoring project conducted with financial IT practitioners, we have gained skills in developing the web through database, Android app development, and JSP as well as project management through youth case definition, ER diagram, requirement tracking chart, etc. As a result, we became interested in web development and gained knowledge of the overall web development through the Java Front-End developer course organized by OOO. We have also developed a customized card recommendation website based on user consumption patterns and developed our development capabilities by using the Vue.js framework. We have experience in achieving A+ results by improving projects that received C+ credits. ""The result of planning failure"" Our team decided to create a mobile 2D jump game app using C# language and Unity. After working hard on the development with our team members, we were able to complete the alpha version of the game a week before the presentation. However, we realized that the more we conducted the test, the less fun the game became. The failure to predict this during the planning stage was the root cause. To make up for this, we added fun elements by adding obstacles and stages, but it was not enough to correct the wrong plan in a short period of time. In the end, our team was poorly evaluated by professors and classmates in the project presentation and received a C+ grade. I couldn't easily accept the C+ grade because all of the ""Methodology"" team members were enthusiastic about developing the game. So, our team decided to improve the problems of the previous project and try again in the graduation project. The waterfall development methodology that was adopted earlier was not suitable for game development that often changes because it is developed based on a fixed plan. Therefore, our team sought a development methodology that could respond quickly to changes, and as a result, we decided to adopt a scrum model that repeats a short development cycle. After adopting the ""C+ game from C+ game to A+ game"" scrum model, we proceeded to develop by checking the results through planning-development-test steps in a short period of time. Through that process, we tried to make a fun game. As a result, I was able to complete the game successfully and even registered an app on the Play Store. In addition, it was well received by professors and classmates, so I was awarded an encouragement award at the project presentation and an A+ grade in the subject. Through this, I realized that not only implementing the project but also introducing appropriate development methodology is very important to the success of the project. ""The most important practical competency - Communication"" I think the most important competency for developers is communication skills. This is because development projects are carried out in cooperation with people in various roles. I think there are two main communication competencies of developers. First, communication through code. I think communication with fellow developers is achieved through code. For smooth communication, I think it is important to write highly readable codes and to accurately comply with work standards within the organization. Second, communication through words. I think developers should be able to accurately grasp the other person's needs and clearly explain what they are trying to say. I also think it is very important to listen to and respect the other person's opinions and strengthen teamwork. ""My Communication Competency Level - 80 Points"" I tried to develop the aforementioned communication competency through various team project experiences. In order to increase the readability of the code, we made efforts to create appropriate method names and variable names so that even other team members could see what function the code was performing at a glance. In addition, we actively used version management systems such as Git and Github to communicate efficiently with team members. ""Problem identification ability and strong will to improve"" My strengths are problem identification ability and strong will to improve. When I was taking the Java Front-End developer course, I had worked on a team project for 1 night and 2 days. Our team decided to develop a website that introduces and reviews famous restaurants and worked on it. Since the project had to be completed during the short development period, the team members distributed their roles and focused on development. And we proceeded with the development by sending the results we developed individually to one person and collecting them. However, before the deadline, we had to face numerous errors in the process of collecting our results. In the end, we had to spend a lot of time debugging and submit unsatisfactory results. Our team's problems were.They were unable to manage the database in their local environment, and because they did not deploy a version management system, they manually combined the codes of each team member. And in the project over the following month, we built a database on the AWS cloud server, so that all of our team members could use the same database to efficiently develop it, and we systematically performed version management using Git and Github. I am confident that my strengths in identifying and actively improving problems will greatly help me quickly diagnose and resolve problems that may arise from Tsis. ""Health management"" My weakness is that I have been negligent in health management. I spent 12 hours a day working on development at the academy while working on the Java Front End developer for three months. As a result, I was negligent in health management, and as a result, I caught the flu and couldn't take the lecture for two days. Through this experience, I became acutely aware that health management is also one of the important items in performing the development job. Since then, I have been paying attention to health management through high-quality nutrition and exercise in my spare time. ""Work knowledge and development, two rabbits."" In five years, I want to become a financial IT expert who is good at both work knowledge and development. In order to become a financial IT expert, I think you need to be able to accurately grasp not only the development capabilities but also the work of the client company. This is because it is possible to accurately understand the requirements of the client and reflect them in the development. To this end, I will acquire work knowledge through active communication and constant learning with the field. In addition, I will continue to learn to improve my development capabilities such as development language, design pattern, and software engineering. ""Project manager"" In 10 years, I want to become a project manager and lead a project to success. The experience of various projects and two PMs gave me the opportunity to feel the importance and attractiveness of project management. I realized that project managers are the most important roles in projects that are involved in all parts of the project, such as schedule management, code management, and development document management, as well as relationships with team members. In order to successfully perform the role of project manager, various development experiences are essential. If I perform my development job at Tiscis, I will try to become a project manager who can produce high-quality software output by enhancing my perspective on the overall development through various development experiences and making my seniors' know-how."
"As technology advances, the gap between urban and rural areas is widening, and I think it is better to balance rural areas by converging rather than balancing them along the cities. With the introduction of ICT technology in rural areas, smart farms are being promoted. Internet connection to plantations and greenhouses is required for this. If high-speed Internet is the basis for this, it will be possible for rural areas to receive educational services regardless of physical space. Effective education is possible through realistic educational services using VR and AR along with the establishment of large-capacity ultra-low-latency networks if 5G networks are introduced, and both programs and learning materials can be delivered to the same level of educational environment through the cloud, regardless of location or terminal. E-commerce will also be strengthened by improving health services and distribution services through public infrastructure or remote medical treatment by applying ICT solutions such as crop theft prevention systems and disaster alarm. In this way, we believe that if the education and health sectors are promoted while taking into account the elderly population of rural areas and the infrastructure is designed in a way that prioritizes inflow over population outflow, the walls between urban and rural areas can be broken down and harmonized. Diversity and acquisition power are my competitiveness. Current technologies are not developing into the field itself, but through convergence with other fields. Seeing this trend, I challenged myself in various fields. While working in a factory, I operated and inspected equipment such as CNC machines and milling machines, and challenged 3D design and design for characters and models, and worked as an instructor in operating equipment, repairing, inspecting, and checking them. What I felt while working in various activities were all related, and my perspective on the system expanded. I learned this point once again while working as an industry-academia project under the theme of smart farm facilities. It is not just about building a database and controlling sensors, but based on this, I realized that how to design the hardware, what are the optimal conditions, and knowledge other than my major is required. When performing a job, I am confident that we will do a job that will be smooth. Smooth communication is possible when cooperating with external companies or other departments, and the system can be planned with a wider perspective. In order to balance urban and rural areas, I think it is a priority to find a way to prevent the outflow of population in rural areas. I thought about what is the biggest factor in the outflow to rural areas. As a result, the biggest reason is the preference for cities with excellent educational infrastructure. What I plan is to make the educational environment the same as the city rather than giving additional points to the excellent selection of rural areas. The biggest goal is to introduce the 5G network in earnest and provide realistic education services using VR and AR that are beyond physical limitations. In addition, programs and learning materials can be provided in the same level of educational environment for both urban and rural areas regardless of location and terminal use. I think it is important to break down the physical wall like this. In addition, in the case of universities, there is already a foundation for an e-learning system, so the system construction period can be shortened in connection with it. If the public's perception improves due to the generalization of realistic education services, the wall on the educational environment between urban and rural areas will be broken down."
"""Motivation for application"" I am not satisfied with the present and always challenge various fields. I am preparing for future technological changes by challenging various fields such as programming, data and AI, and quality control, not just in my major. TmaxSoft has maintained the No. 1 title of JEUS, a web application server, but has not stopped developing technologies by introducing competitive solutions such as TIBERO Data, a DB management solution, and ProFrame, an application framework, to the market. TmaxSoft's constant efforts while leading the middleware market always captured my heart, and I applied with a nervous mind. I applied for a job at TmaxSoft consulting, where I can best demonstrate my experience in analyzing competitors, taking charge of SW knowledge and marketing projects including DB, AI, and development that I have. As an engineering student, I want to provide principles and information of products that are easy to understand through direct communication with customers. And I will become a new employee in the consulting job who will serve as a bridge to analyze VOCs and deliver them to R&D and technical support departments to improve products. ""Aspiring after joining the company"" Going beyond simply selling solutions to customers, I will act as a bridge between technology support engineers and customers who install solutions to customers. Through this bridge role, I will deliver the conditions and plans that customers want to the technical support engineers to increase customer satisfaction and make TmaxSoft's solution the best in 10 years. And with the AI technology that I have, I would like to understand the demands and requirements of customers and collaborate with the R&D department on artificial intelligence solutions. When TmaxSoft developed AI, deep learning, and machine learning solutions, we will explain them at the customer's level based on the artificial intelligence knowledge and provide the best solution with appropriate price competitiveness according to the customer's environment. And I will not end with selling solutions, but I will become a consultant who helps develop better products by grasping the customer's voice through constant communication even when the customer company uses TmaxSoft's solutions. I majored in material engineering in ""Challenging Personality - Constant Self-Development"", but I have been challenging the field of IT anew. First of all, we started with web programming, processed and visualized tremendous data, and now we are learning a new technology, AI, in the face of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Among the deep learning models, I have experience in building a model that automatically blurs personal information such as faces and license plates, which can be an issue in SNS, single media, and others by using the Faster R-CNN model. While taking KT AI Academy, I worked on a project based on what I learned, such as deep learning and machine learning. I came up with the idea that personal information is a problem because the faces of ordinary people who are not related to content and license plates of vehicles come out on blogs, SNS, and one-person media broadcasts. Previously, Kakao launched a map and blurred using the Faster R-CNN model in Roadview, but there was no public information such as code and data, so I selected a topic that anyone, including single media operators and SNS users, could use. For three weeks, four team members analyzed the base paper related to the Faster R-CNN model and built the model with tensorflow using Github's open source. The Python code was changed for blur processing, and the two modules, object detection and blur, were merged into a shell script in two steps so that they could use both the Faster R-CNN model and blur. For training, we performed 110,000 iteration of 5 epochs using the WIDERFACE dataset, and for license plates, we performed training with 5 epochs with 1,200 pieces of data taken by ourselves. We tried the training for the first time and detected the license plate. However, there was a problem of recognizing only the faint license plate, not the clear license plate. And in principle, there should be one bounding box per person for facial data, but there was a problem of catching multiple bounding boxes. In order to solve the problem, we asked researchers from KT Convergence Technology Institute to increase the iteration of training and increase the number of clear vehicle license plates and large face datasets. My role in the team was to analyze the paper and use Faster R-CNN, pyblur code analysis, and movingPY to blur in the existing video to produce the result. At first, I tried to make it into an app, but it was not implemented due to lack of time and technology. As an alternative, after cutting the video frame by frame and processing the blur processing, the pictures were combined through movingPY to create the result as a video. By applying this model to street broadcasting, we applied blur processing on the faces of ordinary people who had nothing to do with the content, and achieved an accuracy of exceeding mAP 0.5. Due to the high accuracy, the demo video came out well, so we were able to achieve good results on the KT Convergence Technology Institute road show, and whether or not to commercialize it is in progress because patents are currently in progress. Using the ""Development Project - Rich IT Experience"" JSP and Maria DB, I have experience in building a hamburger delivery system based on the logistics information system. In the web page implementation project for about two weeks, I implemented the web design with CSS. Among them, my role was the role of the developer in charge of the bulletin board and the DB manager. Using eXERD, a total of 9 DBs required for delivery services from raw material inventory were modeled and built as maria DB. Although I was a DB manager who thought it would end with the design and construction of the DB, I often reflected the opinions of my team members and revised it during the project for a total of two weeks. After about 30 DB modifications, I learned the DB construction process in the project.Along with the DB manager, I have been making efforts to create a perfect bulletin board by organizing bulletin boards with JSP files. Based on what I learned in class, I went through numerous trials and errors to attach files and to put them on the list, but after tenacious challenge, I was able to taste success. ""Achieving Mentee's Dream"" In mentoring for out-of-school youth, I introduced a agonizing and career counseling program to boost student motivation, and I had the experience of achieving student goals in the same year. I taught English and math as mentors to out-of-school youth preparing for the GED with the goal of passing the GED. Other mentors also taught class with the goal of passing the GED, so I also focused at first on teaching the subject. However, Mentee was bored with repetitive classes and needed stimulation to motivate them anew. In order to understand what they want to be in the future, their daily worries, and the goal of taking the GED, we made a 15-minute daily counseling session every day, including the class. Through guidelines and homework, they created an opportunity for mentee to agonize every week. In this process, it led Mentee to dream of becoming an aircraft mechanic. Especially since I was a graduate of the aviation college, I was able to give vivid information such as what subjects the aviation students were learning and how they prepared. Mentee set a specific goal of entering the Department of Aviation Maintenance at Inha University or entering the Department of Language and Literature at a four-year university by utilizing Mentee's English ability as a result of counseling her concerns in the curriculum where she had only taught previously. Other mentors were also interested in this change, so I provided the same format of guidelines and forms I used to other mentors as well. Although pure class time was reduced, Mentee, who set the goal right, had been meticulously doing a larger amount of homework than before, so the class progress was able to go further. Mentee found her dream and received high scores on the high school entrance and high school graduation exam, and the following year, she became a college freshman majoring in English literature and was able to achieve her goal. ""The Best Outcome of Communication"" Two science and engineering students and two humanities students gathered to receive the grand prize for the ""Photo App Life Marketing Strategy."" Team members who had no expertise worked together to carry out projects and challenged new fields through communication beyond each major to achieve the best grades. As an engineering student, I participated in a small and medium-sized business experience camp to challenge a new field of marketing. However, the friends who were assigned to the same team were distant from marketing to the extent that this desire was overshadowed. Two humanities students and one science and engineering student like me had to come up with an application promotion strategy. From the first meeting, I only came up with vague ideas and couldn't even get an outline. The problem was not the lack of expertise, but the lack of confidence. As a team leader, I wanted to give him confidence, so through interviews with my team members, I talked about the areas that the team members could do well and suggested doing what they could best. Contrary to the atmosphere before when I was not confident, I was able to freely talk about their specialties, and through the process, I was able to boost my confidence. Thanks to this, science and engineering students are good at analyzing data, so we analyzed the success factors of our competitors, Daygram and Analog Tokyo, and the students of the Department of Public Administration focused on measuring the expected effectiveness of marketing and making presentation table of contents data. It was a marketing strategy task that seemed to have been unable to do, but it was outlined in the direction of ""promoting through SNS by paying activity fees to university students in Daegu,"" and based on this, we were able to increase the reality through a balanced perspective between science and engineering and liberal arts. What I thought was a weakness became a strength, and since we analyzed and benchmarked our competitors well, we were able to receive the grand prize from teams from all over the country.."
"I have often used the Altools series from Eastsoft Corporation. I had a familiar image about it, and I decided that although I was a contract worker, it could be an experience for me to join Eastsoft in the future. I have a lot of part-time job experience such as factories, convenience stores, restaurants, and frozen air conditioners. I have experienced various fields, and accordingly, I have also learned skills such as 3D printing, drones, CNC machines, milling machines, etc. In order to proceed with the entrusted work efficiently, I continued to learn related knowledge, showed good results, and formed a smooth relationship, and I still keep in touch with the business owners until now. I had various experiences and realized what is my favorite job and what is my aptitude. As a result, I chose the software field and applied for the data construction assistant to lay the foundation for my career. I have the experience of working hard at three part-time jobs at the same time without any difficulties in being late or working. In order to manage 3D printers that are new to the factory, I have worked hard as an assistant 3D printing instructor and received a business proposal for the 3D printing technology. If the task is assigned, I can tell you from experience that you can work faithfully in a focused attitude without being lazy. As mentioned earlier, learning will continue for better results or shortcomings during the process."
"Distribution was the most impressive field among various fields, such as restaurant, distribution, and finance, which I experienced while working as an IT consulting intern. With the idea of a new business, I planned a ""face-to-face identification solution"" targeting unmanned convenience stores. Currently, alcohol sales at unmanned convenience stores require confirmation from employees face-to-face, and cigarettes have limitations in that they can only buy cigarettes after each time being verified by ID card. With this in mind, I suggested a way to purchase cigarettes with one face authentication by simultaneously authenticating the face and ID card through IT and storing it in the DB. Overcoming the limitations of unmanned goods that the distribution industry has with AI was able to receive a good evaluation. GS ITM has an SCO (unmanned checkout counter) solution and is preparing an unmanned solution for the distribution industry with an automatic ordering system. After completing GS ITM's six-month training, I would like to solve the limitations of the unmanned distribution business's current ""stock clearing by people,"" ""preventing theft of goods,"" and ""face-to-face sales of cigarettes"" through IT. I will become a developer who leads the unmanned distribution business solutions such as managing the inventory of shelves using IoT sensors, preventing theft using intelligent CCTV, and purchasing cigarettes using face and ID recognition. Meanwhile, while preparing for the distribution business project, I found that there are many useful data such as order history data at convenience stores and supermarkets, customer age using intelligent CCTV, gender data, and data on products that sell well according to commercial districts. If this is analyzed as big data, there are many areas where IT can be utilized, such as developing new menus and planning new product promotions at the headquarters level. I will become a talented person who discovers opportunities in these data based on my AI and big data analysis capabilities that I have developed steadily so far. ""Web development - Creating a Hamburger Delivery Web Page"" I have learned JAVA-based web programming technology to specify the career path of IT developers. I have experience in building a hamburger delivery system based on a logistics information system, using JSP and Maria DB. Benchmarking McDelivery, I built the 'OOO Delivery' web page based on the logistics information system. I was in charge of developing the late bulletin board and designing, building, and generalizing the DB table. Using Maria DB, we implemented the function with SQL statements and created a bulletin board that can upload photos in conjunction with the web. Meanwhile, we modeled and built the DB required for the service by using eXERD, a data modeling tool. Although I thought it would end with the design and construction of the DB, many problems were found in the implementation process, and the DB was successfully built through more than 30 revisions. It took a lot of time and effort, but I was able to fully learn the DB construction process and web development. Not only did I develop software for ""AI Development - Personal Information Protection Automatic Blur Project"" but I also challenged AI projects. Among them, the experience that helped the most was the automatic privacy blur project. Using the Faster R-CNN model, we built an AI model that automatically blurs personal information that can be an issue in a single-person broadcast. We learned with 500 photos and performed the task of detecting license plates, but we did not recognize faint license plates, and there was a problem of recognizing one face as multiple faces. In order to solve the problem, I suggested taking pictures of license plates and using various facial Datasets. We learned more than 5 times per photo, and increased the number of clear vehicle license plates and big face datasets. By applying the model to single-person media, we achieved the accuracy of exceeding mAP 0.5 by blurring the face of the general public, and we were able to climb the KT Convergence Technology Institute road show where two out of six teams could participate. I have experience in creating web pages by gathering three non-majors who had no experience in using the spring framework ""to make difficulties enjoyable."" The final project of the six-month SW developer process was to create web pages with the spring framework, analyze big data, and visualize them. It was a project conducted by five people, but two people were absent due to preparation for an interview, and three team members, including me, had to decide whether to proceed with the project as it is or join the team with majors one by one. I thought that it would be more beneficial to study the project together even though it would take a lot of time and effort, so I encouraged my team members and chose the former. Since all three were non-majors, I had to study from the basics, and the concept of the spring framework was difficult compared to Java, JSP, and html/CSS in the previous process. To overcome this, I took a YouTube Spring Framework life coding course and shared progress tables with my team members separately from the class. Through the lecture, I learned the MVC pattern theory and changed the website 'KIC Delivery', which was created by the existing JSP project, to the Spring Framework to learn the practical sense. It started from a different starting point due to the constraints of insufficient number of people and knowledge, but I was able to complete the project called 'FC Barcelona Korean Web Page' within a fixed period of time. It is an experience where I was able to complete the curriculum with the 'Academic Promotion Award' as I appreciate that three non-majors realized a high-level web page without giving up, and I was able to feel the joy of overcoming difficulties. ""New Challenge in the Marketing Field"" Four non-majors unrelated to marketing and application challenged marketing and won first place out of 32 teams. As an engineering student, I wanted to challenge a new field of marketing by working on a team project with people from various majors. Our team's challenge was 'How to promote the LIFE app using SNS' of OOOO, a start-up. However, none of the team members had studied marketing, and I, as the team leader, started distributing tasks to efficiently proceed with the project.We collected opinions from target groups and distributed presentation materials to the team members who majored in political science and public administration with a lot of experience in research. We installed competitor apps directly to each team member who uses Android and iOS to analyze where they gained consumers' sympathy. Finally, we submitted 'OO University Students' One to One SNS Marketing'. We received high marks for effectively benchmarking the strengths by analyzing competitors' marketing plans and submitting a highly feasible plan, and we were able to rank No. 1 among the 32 teams that participated in the camp. 1. Reason for Challenge: Four non-majors who had nothing to do with marketing and apps challenged marketing 2. Reason for Participation: I wanted to know why people are avoiding small and medium-sized enterprises, because I was curious about the current situation of start-ups 3. Difficulties: Because they were all non-majors, I didn't know where to approach and where to start. 4. Efforts to overcome: Finding fundamental information about marketing, I realized that I had to specify targets first. And in order to boost the morale of the team members, I distribute tasks in consideration of the majors of the team members, which were divided into sociology, public administration, chemistry, and material engineering. ex) Social and administration -> Gathering opinions from target groups, producing presentation materials, chemistry, material engineering -> Analyzing the marketing plans of the competitors and role models of the company in charge, installing apps to find out where consumers sympathized. And the role of the person in charge of the company constantly. 5. Result: Finally, a plan was submitted to promote SNS, which paid for activities to university students in the OO area. Non-majors scored high in that they analyzed and benchmarked competitors' marketing plans and submitted realistic plans, and were given the honor of being the first place among the 32 teams that participated in the camp. ""My first living alone with my cousin."" The moment when I settled my boarding life for the past three years and found a room in Seoul and started living alone with my cousin was the happiest moment. I have been living in the dorm for three years in high school and one year in college, and for three years in college, I have been in the dorm. I wanted to make and eat the menu I wanted at the time I wanted, but it was not easy due to the conditions of the boarding house. After graduation, my cousin who lived in Daegu finally found a room and moved in with me after getting a job in Seoul. I moved in and out of the marts with my sister, enjoying cooking. I was able to make and eat various kinds of pasta, such as aglio e olio, vongole, carbonara, pomodoro, and my cooking skills improved day by day. This is the happiest moment in my life when I started living on my own, which I had dreamed of."
"""Jealousy is my strength"" Since childhood, I was an ordinary child who had nothing better or special than anyone else. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends while comparing myself to others. When someone did something, I was greedy to do just that much, so I had to go beyond that friend to be satisfied. My first step was jealousy of a one-year-old Tuul's cousin when I turned 10. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy memorizing Chinese characters at an early age, I started learning Chinese characters because I felt that I could do with jealousy. As I studied for four years after that, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and I was able to maintain excellent grades in Chinese literature in middle and high school. During my school years, I was able to achieve unexpected results through competition with my friends. I competed with a friend who memorized world geography, and I started memorizing world maps, and I got a good opportunity by appearing in the Golden Bell. Another time, when a friend with similar writing skills went to an essay writing academy and got a job better, I got to go to the same academy because I didn't want to lose with essay writing. After a while, I won a prize in an essay contest for the first time in my life. I am sure that I am an extremely ordinary person now and in the past. However, I have continued to develop myself with the desire to improve, and as I have done in the past, I will continue to compare myself with the people around me so that their strengths can be mine. When I was taking the ""Sniffing"" management information system course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. I thought I usually lacked leadership, so I volunteered to lead, and I collected the opinions of the team members and divided roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, during the interim inspection, the degree of completion fell compared to other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. When the presentation was over and we exchanged opinions on the deficiencies, many said that the information we were looking for was less interesting than we thought. So, in order to lead the participation of the team members, we will apply for an IT fair and a corporate tour and go together. I was able to solve my questions by conducting interviews with working-level officials, and I was able to see and operate security products and new technologies by observing them together at the World IT Show. I was able to complete the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short time. Through this, I was able to fill in the lack of leadership and learn the importance of communication. I will help you successfully finish the project by finding a way to ventilate whenever the project creaks due to the lack of motivation among the team members. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a student. The incident in which a 9-year-old boy manipulated a TV remote control and caused a train accident shocked me a lot at the time. Since then, I started studying while looking for materials on the security industry. As my first presentation after entering college, I had time to study the history of the virus and cyberwarfare in preparation for cyber terrorism. Recently, ransomware and exchange hacking have increased rapidly, and the importance of information security is increasing. In particular, security is like life because the financial sector is directly connected to the assets of customers. INITECH has solidified its position by developing and providing various security solutions from mobile to DB and IOT, and is striving to develop a blockchain-based authentication system this year. As a member of INITECH, I will study various products and technologies to become a security leader in the upcoming 5G era."
"""Growing Up Through Competition"" Since childhood, I was an ordinary child with nothing special about it. As a result, I had a high sense of competition with my friends around me. I was greedy to do something and do just that much when someone did it. The first step is to compete against a cousin of a one-year-old Tuul, who is 10 years old. When I listened to the sound of a child prodigy while memorizing Chinese letters, I started learning Chinese characters thinking I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. After learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through Chinese character verification, and as a result, I got excellent grades in Chinese literature when I was in middle and high school. During my school years, I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and started memorizing world maps, and participated in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Once again, when my friend's writing skills improved greatly, I started reading and essay writing and won an essay contest. I have always been an ordinary person. However, I have a strong desire to improve myself. I will continue to digest the strengths of those around me as my own and improve myself. 1. I learned various languages such as C/C++ and JAVA in each grade, and I conducted development projects based on the languages I learned. I decided to develop a trash can management page because I noticed the problem of trash cans that usually overflowed with trash. Working on the project in pairs, I was in charge of DB and server. I received real-time values of lid opening and closing, loading, and fire from the sensor, stored them in the DB, and floated them on the web. However, since I worked with internal IP on campus, there was a fatal problem in that I could not access the finished web. At that time, professors and seniors also recommended receiving a new IP address in the computer room. However, I understood the structure of the network and solved the problem by designating a new DNS. I received an A in the development project subject with the completed work, and I linked it with the classroom trash can, leading to a reduction in collection costs through efficient management. 2. I built a network using routers while taking the system operation Internet security. I configured and redistributed dynamic and static routing tables, and built a firewall using Linux. In the security network, I analyzed packets in real time and performed defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting. After graduation, I completed an information security training course for 8 months, learning how to operate security equipment and how to check vulnerabilities. Based on what I learned in this course, I challenged and passed the network manager level 2 and became an information processing technician, and now I am studying security law with the aim of becoming an information security technician. I entered this path after watching a documentary on cyber terrorism when I was a test taker. A train accident caused by a 9-year-old boy manipulating a TV remote control shocked me a lot. Since then, I started to study information security by looking at the history of cyber terrorism and viruses. While studying IT security, I realized that it is more important to put corporate assets and information first than to develop convenient services. To this end, I will conduct systematic and continuous information protection activities. I will establish a defense policy by analyzing past hacking cases of financial, telecommunications, and IT companies, and attend security conferences every year to learn new technologies and security information. Based on my accumulated practical experience, I will acquire CISSP and CISA to acquire international-level security technology skills. Thus, I will contribute to obtaining ISMS-P certification for stable system management."
"First, when I took C language, which is the basis for development ability programming, I was in charge of the team leader. It was a good opportunity to develop leadership and achieve A+ by looking at the team members' assignments and studying or teaching them what they did not know. I learned various languages such as C++, JAVA, and Python in each grade, and I proceeded with development projects based on the learned languages. In the project, I was in charge of building a web server, and I installed Debian on Raspabei and uploaded the value stored in the DB to the web server. Second, I built a network using a router while taking Internet security for stable system operation. Dynamic and static routing tables were configured and redistributed, and firewalls were also built using Linux. In the security network, packets were analyzed in real time and defense activities such as firewall setting and policy setting were performed. After graduation, I completed an information security curriculum for 8 months and learned how to check security equipment and vulnerabilities for stable server operation. Based on what I learned in the process, I challenged and passed the network manager level 2 and an information processing technician. Finally, my goal is to obtain an information security technician. Third, I have done web programming studies with my friends to learn html and jsp. I was able to develop my competency by creating a simple web page using CSS, to creating a bulletin board linked to the DB. Through this study, I obtained A in the web page construction course. In addition, I visited IT exhibitions for 3 years, saw new products and technologies in person, and expanded my knowledge by listening to explanations. When I was taking the ""Leadership-Problem Solving Ability"" management information system course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. In order to take the lead in performing the task, I volunteered to lead the team, and collected the opinions of the team members and distributed their roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, during the interim inspection, the completeness was inferior to that of other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, when I shared my opinions on the insufficient part, there were many opinions that the information I was looking for was less and interested than I thought. So, I look for various ways to lead the team members to participate. First of all, I will attend the World IT Show with my team members. I was able to encounter security products and new technologies in response to infringement accidents, and learned about future information security tasks. In addition, I apply for an IT company tour to facilitate the progress of the assignment. Although I did not know the infrastructure and technology because corporate security was confidential to the public, I was able to resolve my questions by conducting interviews with practitioners. I was able to complete the project by building rapport and increasing participation in a short period of time. This made me realize the importance of communication and cooperation. I will help you find a way to ventilate whenever the team members' performance creaks due to their lack of motivation when performing construction work. It was when I was volunteering at OO Library. I was assigned to the understaffed children's library on the second floor. Although it is the same size space, the work of Seo Ga-jeong-ri has doubled. Unlike adults, children often hid books to read only for themselves, or left new books on the floor to take out. So I started changing children's behavior to two words: 'Good Child' and 'Bad Child'. He praised me as a good kid when I put a book I read in the book cart or organized a table, and told me that I was a bad kid when I brought out a large amount of books or scattered books, and led me to do the right thing by telling me how to become a good kid. When I was taking the Management Information System course, I carried out a project on the subject of corporate security. In order to take the lead in carrying out the task, I volunteered as the leader, and collected the opinions of the team members and divided their roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, only silence passed. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection decreased compared to other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. When the presentation was over and we shared opinions on the shortcomings, there were many opinions that the information we were looking for was less and interested than we thought. So, we look for various ways to lead our team members to participate. First of all, we will attend the World IT Show together with our team members. I was able to encounter security products and new technologies that responded to infringement accidents, and I was able to learn about future information security tasks. In addition, I apply for an IT company tour for smooth task progress. Although I did not know the infrastructure and technology because corporate security was confidential to the public, I was able to resolve my questions by conducting interviews with working-level officials. I was able to complete the project in a short period of time by building rapport and increasing participation. This made me realize the importance of communication and cooperation. I will find ways to ventilate the construction work whenever the team members' performance creaks due to their lack of motivation, and I will help them successfully complete the construction work. When I served in the military as a ""blood donation angel,"" I started donating blood with the desire to receive another day of reward leave. However, a small incident changed my mind. When I heard that my grandfather was going to undergo surgery, I donated the blood donation certificate. It was a good opportunity for me to feel that a small act could be of great help to the other person. With this opportunity, everyone's pursuit of happiness based on social contribution has become my ideology"
"I often hear from people around me that I have a strong sense of responsibility for my job. I sometimes lose money in my job due to a strong sense of responsibility, but the reward and achievement I get from completing my job often become the driving force of my life. When I was undergraduate, I participated in volunteer activities to help students learn the subject by mentoring low-income students. Through this OO project, I formed a relationship with two students, and I wanted to be a mentor who was academically and psychologically helpful as the students were in poor circumstances. In order to use the limited time efficiently, I organized a program plan and taught, and I tried to build friendships by leaving the school with the students. For the examinees, the service period was extended from 6 months to 1 year, and as a result, the students received satisfactory SAT grades. When I came home from the mentoring, I was physically challenged after midnight, but I was proud that it was an unforgettable help to the students, and I came to think of the weight of responsibility as the driving force of my action. The first competency required is the ability to handle and analyze data. When I was an undergraduate, I took courses in SAS, R, SQL, and SPSS, and learned the overall process of analysis that extracted the desired data from the DB and used statistical programming to find insights. In addition, prior to the analysis, I realized the ETL process, which accumulates data, the importance of system planning, and construction, and acquired insufficient knowledge by reading database-related books. I acquired statistical certifications about SAS and R, as well as in-depth information about data mining techniques and data structures. The second is organizational and communication skills. I tried a big data contest with my colleagues during my undergraduate years, but I couldn't spend much time because one of my friends passed the internship. It was difficult because of the limited time, but I knew that if each role was fused well, 1+1 could make 10 instead of 3, so I invited the leader to take on each of them. My friend who works in front of the computer is in charge of data cleansing, and I was in charge of PPT, which my friend who is studying for exams is good at writing documents, preparing files, and having a lot of time. As a result, I successfully completed 40 PPTs, and I realized that I could change the organization with an attitude to understand and be considerate of the other person's situation, and that sharing of planned work could increase the efficiency and morale of work. The most important value in my life is '유비무환'입니다'. While working in the Korean traditional music club when I was in middle school, I had the opportunity to perform at a concert with my friends as the representative of the school. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep as it was a big stage. However, my parents taught me that the only solution for achieving and succeeding my goals was thorough practice and preparation, and I practiced so much that I got blisters on my fingers. As a result, I was able to finish the concert without making any mistakes, and I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy through the applause and support I received after finishing the stage. Through this, I realized the need to prepare to achieve a high goal, and I was able to have the habit of preparing more thoroughly than anyone else when challenging new work. With these values, I will complete the internship before joining the company and lay the foundation for becoming a new employee. In order to carry out IT operations, I will learn the structure and principles of software and learn the operational processes to manage the operations of the Dong-A Socio Group throughout the company. I believe that the rapid aging process provides greater growth opportunities for the pharmaceutical and bio industries due to the expansion of the need to engage in healthy physical and social activities without disease. In fact, the domestic pharmaceutical market has established itself as a future food industry, maintaining an annual growth rate of 3% over the past five years despite the global economic downturn. As a member of the Dong-A Socio Group with such high growth potential, I applied to provide innovative IT services for the growth of the group. I believe that a company's IT system performance can determine the existence of a company from a small difference in performance and a large difference in performance. By providing services and insights suitable for various affiliates, the group will contribute to securing business competitiveness, thereby contributing to the growth of the Dong-A Socio Group into a global pharmaceutical company beyond Korea."
"""GS SHOP Who Knows Me Better Than My Family."" A father became angry at a store that offered coupons for baby products such as formula and diapers to his underage daughter, and asked, ""Do you want my daughter to become pregnant?"" and the mart apologized, saying, ""I am sorry."" However, it turned out that she was really pregnant and my father couldn't hide his surprise. This is an example I read in a book about big data. Big data has the power to accurately grasp the needs of customers that even their close family members do not know about. I want to analyze such data so that I can easily expose the products that customers want and make purchases. I applied because I was confident that GS SHOP, which does not spare no investment in big data for mobile-only malls and introduces customized products to enhance customer convenience. ""For data analysts,"" studying various coding and constant self-improvement are essential to handle big data effectively. When I was an undergraduate, I learned various statistical packages such as SPSS, R, and SAS. Among them, the Statistical Programming (1) subject of learning SAS was the most difficult. I was not familiar with the coding language, so I had a hard time writing the script myself, and eventually I got a grade called c+. Although I was frustrated with my low grades, I realized that I was lacking in my capacity and started to study further by myself. I acquired all my certificates at once without fail, and I was able to have confidence in dealing with the statistical package called SAS. I worked on statistical analysis and customer process improvement proposal for 2 billion global customers of OOOOOO, a client company, at a consulting firm called ""Intern but in charge of One Brand OOO,"" and achieved achievement in charge of one brand, OOOOO, although I am an intern with fast adaptability and strong responsibility. When I was told that a program called Netizen used SQL language to extract data before joining the company, I focused on studying MYSQL and studying what are the most efficient queries I learned in my undergraduate days. As a result, I was able to quickly adapt to my work, take on unscheduled customer analysis tasks, and provide direct analysis services to customer companies. During my internship, the most passionate task was to write an 'Indepth Report' that analyzed purchase data. What was regrettable about writing various reports related to promotions and membership was that the analysis technique using statistical programming was not introduced to the company. When analyzing data on the subject of ""strong product experience rate"", R was introduced to analyze the correlation, and a strategy was proposed to induce CROSS-SELLING by applying rules with high improvement and reliability. By using the new statistical programming, we were able to provide in-depth reports to our customers and receive positive feedback. I felt aptitude and interested in the job of finding insights with these customers' purchase data and establishing a better strategy, and I would like to present detailed recommended products and strategies to GS SHOP customers using my various statistical analysis skills. Mentoring, which I participated in for a year of ""87 Hours of Mentoring"", was difficult for me, but it is an experience that I realized the true meaning of giving and feeling the most proud. I made a relationship with two students through the OO project, and I wanted to help them improve their grades as I am a low-income student who cannot attend private tutoring or private academies. I organized the data I collected while working part-time at the academy and provided them to students, and I gave them answers to problems I did not know through messenger. After the scheduled service period of one semester ended, the students expressed to their teacher that they wanted to receive mentoring from me next year when they will be their third year of high school. I was worried because I had a new part-time job scheduled and had a plan to be faithful to my studies, but I thought it would be of unforgettable help to mentees who are taking the test, so I extended my service period by one more semester. As a result, the students' grades improved remarkably and the teacher recommended me as an excellent mentor with a responsible appearance for a year. I felt a lot from the words of students who said, ""I had a lot of problems I didn't know, but you were a great help."" I realized the true meaning of giving and the responsible behavior is that I can give trust and trust to people. Even after joining GS SHOP, I will participate in various social contribution activities in the company and try to complete my work with responsible actions. ""Short term: Convergence and Data Understanding"" After joining the company, I will first greet you in order to harmonize well with the company. My boss and colleagues at work are my second family. I will always greet my bosses who spend a lot of time together with me with a smile first and deliver my energetic energy. I will also understand the company's database and processes accurately. The data that GS SHOP has accumulated over the years is a valuable business resource for the company. As a new employee, I will learn how to understand the system and deal with the data without making any mistakes rather than just trying to deal with the data right away. I will study the distribution and logistics knowledge that I lack in ""Medium-term: Understanding Distribution and Logistics Systems."" By analyzing customer characteristics, I will try to contribute to all tasks by not only analyzing data such as product recommendation but also sales forecast using big data and product defect prediction in the logistics process. ""Long-term: Improving Global Capabilities"" In order to grow GS SHOP, which was selected as a professional trading company in the home shopping industry for the first time in March this year, I will try to study the language and understand the trends and tendencies of the countries in which I entered. During the internship period, I analyzed the results of launching China's Innisfree app. As a platform called ""WeChat"" is strongly established in China, we found that it has a lower number of app downloads and utilization rates than other Asian countries. GS SHOP will establish data analysis and strategies that take into account the characteristics of each country in order to successfully enter various overseas markets."
"I have the thought of ""challenge, gain after learning, my own asset"" and ""learning every experience in life,"" so I always enjoy passionately challenging myself. When I was a college student, I worked as an assistant to OOO applications for 3,000 companies in Seoul. As a part-time job, I always recorded the company name, number, and delivery details after phone consultation to prepare for misinformation delivery. While checking the records, I confirmed that I delivered the wrong information to the company. And after contacting the person in charge, I corrected the information to prevent accidents. Through this experience, I learned not only meticulousness and responsibility in handling work, but also relationships with people and harmony. Although it was a trivial experience, the positive idea of learning allowed me to take on a responsible challenge by releasing the burden of every experience. As a result, I was able to develop many abilities of myself, which soon became a valuable asset for me. Challenging passionately is the most valuable value that has created various assets for me, and I am still creating new ones. ""From the First to the Best"" Currently, K-Bank is Korea's first Internet company, and it is positioned noteworthy in the global market. It ignited my potential passion by seeing him try something no one expected first and always run for the best. I have a goal to show my passion to challenge and explore new things without hesitation at K-Bank. We will provide convenient and easy services to more customers through constant inquiry and research. We will strive to be recognized as the best company in the global market by enhancing customer satisfaction and establishing a foothold to expand into the world. I will not be complacent but develop creative and innovative thinking through constant self-development so that I can have an eye for the future. With such an active attitude and passion, I will become a talented person who can take responsibility for K-Bank's bright future by transforming into a multi-talented expert. ""Analist? Developer?"" When I was working as an intern in beauty e-commerce, I led the project responsibly and meticulously so that I could not recognize that I was an intern in the collaboration department. Log data loading was attempted for customer behavior analysis, and the project was carried out. It was a task that required a great sense of responsibility because my plan determines the accuracy of data, the workload of the collaboration department, and the quality of analysis. We started communicating with an emphasis on how the development work would be efficient and how analysis would be more convenient. At first, there were mistakes, but thanks to communicating with responsibility, the collaboration department trusted and followed the plan and wanted to be with us in the future. Since the work efficiency of many people was determined by my plan, I worked with a great sense of responsibility, and it was an opportunity to be recognized for my expertise with that sense of responsibility. In addition, various customer behavior analysis was attempted based on the planned data. After various analyzes such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, and app usability, the biggest insight I gained was one. The purpose of all the analysis at the company was to attract new users or prevent existing users from leaving. Changes such as better usability and platform-only service provision were all aimed at increasing the length of stay because customers were satisfied with our service. In general, new users were more than twice as likely to leave within a short period of time as existing users. Therefore, we found that preventing existing users from leaving was an effective strategy in the limited budget plan rather than attracting new users. He has high competencies in data analysis and engineering as a contest and intern, and has a general understanding of marketing and development fields through the progress of previous projects. I believe that a general understanding from development and data processing to the marketing stage that applies it will be a great strength in performing the task. Based on a general understanding of the industry and work, we will create new thoughts and creative values within K-Bank by understanding colleagues as well as understanding customers. Through collaboration to understand the other party's ""value created by collaboration,"" I have experience in solving problems and achieving successful results. In the big data marketing competition, analysts and marketers collaborated based on their understanding of each other to smoothly proceed with the competition and had a chance to win the prize in the competition. In addition, I communicated with about 40 people in charge of marketing, development, and engineering teams when I was working as an intern at a small and medium-sized company, and led and successfully completed the project under the title of an intern. This result could have been attributed not to simple collaboration but to the attitude of understanding the collaborating colleagues and trying to communicate with them sincerely. Communication is an important factor in the process of creating value through data and is the most basic element of continuing cooperative relationships with partners throughout the job. I want to add unique value to K-Bank through my strengths in strong analysis and communication skills. ""Creating new paths, new definitions"" people always want to know what they don't know, know more, and explain what they know. The unknown X in the equation is the number of freedom that makes it possible to explain this desire. People continue to strive to find answers to undefined unknown, and the launch of K-Bank is the primary outcome and future of efforts to find answers. As a financial-IT convergence talent, I will inspire new and diverse thoughts in K-Bank. A departure from finance can be defined as a banking termination, but a departure from an Internet-only bank can be defined as the last day of use of the page and marketing can be carried out. As it is the first Internet-only bank, a different idea and definition are needed to create new value.K-Bank, which was born through constant effort, and a variable called me, who is creative and not afraid of challenges, will form an equation to create a creative unknown X that no one expected."
"As an analytical consumer in return for behavioral analysis, I was delighted in analyzing information and delivering it to others. And I was very interested in observing and predicting how customers' responses changed before and after information was delivered. In order to increase the accuracy of the information to be presented to customers, I have increased my statistical ability. In addition, I have invested time generously in participating in external activities, contests, and internships in order to utilize this in practice. In the process of realizing these dreams, I participated in an internship and strengthened my commitment to joining the game industry. We analyzed the behavioral data of 3 million members through leading data planning and analysis during my internship at a commerce company and conducted an analysis of the behavioral data of online shopping customers. Until then, I did not think that online customers' behavior would respond as a result of various factors such as departure and inflow, influenced by the subtleties and trivial experiences. However, through the analysis process, I found it very attractive to understand changes in user behavior. As a result, in order to understand more detailed customer behavior in the field of games that make up another society online, we have firmly established our willingness to work in the game industry. By incorporating my wishes and strengths into my duties, I want to create a game that anyone can enjoy easily and interestingly, and a game that everyone can enjoy together. I will not be complacent but develop creative thinking and innovative thinking through constant self-improvement so that I can have an eye for the future. With such an active attitude and passion, I want to create a world where I become one by transforming into a multi-savvy professional as well as a professional. ""Short Introduction of the Kakao Games Developer Conference Leave Session Leadership"" Hello, I am a new employee who will be presenting the KDC Game Leave Session. I am very proud and nervous to present the results of my research here five years ago after the determination and effort to grow into an analyst. When I first joined the company, I realized the importance of exploratory analysis, and I had a habit that I did not neglect and an attitude that I always tried to learn new things by making efforts. Data processing and exploratory analysis were important preparations that laid the foundation for all analyses, which provided a solid foundation for my analysis. In addition, I was able to broaden my knowledge of statistics and new technologies by utilizing education and books within the company. And through in-house and outside lectures, I shared data on the analysis and made it my own. The important thing in analysis is not algorithms, but how to create a good learning set. So, because sharing opportunities are more important, I have participated in many conferences since I was a student, and after joining the company, I have volunteered as a speaker. Now, in the first year after I joined Kakao Games as an intern, I have laid the foundation for game analysis, and through this process of effort, the decision to conduct a successful departure analysis that I vaguely dreamed of in the past has become a reality, leading to the development of an R package with a higher prediction rate than in the past. This passion could greatly contribute to the success of our company's game. I think that the field of analysis is an area where the subject of analysis is endless and the field of analysis is endless. So, my future plan will still be to conduct departure analysis with a high prediction rate to achieve perfect modeling. And I want to create a game that anyone can easily enjoy by analyzing customer behavior by game genre, such as the impact of early experience on users, gamebot and abnormal user detection modeling, increasing marketing efficiency in the game process, and increasing customer behavior in each game genre. I'm very excited because it's my first time holding it. I will also present the departure analysis and the R package development process with burning passion. I acknowledged the failure of ""growing attitude on experience"" and tried to find the cause and use it as the basis for my growth. I participated in L company's contest and directly implemented and attempted the predictive modeling of personalized product recommendation. At this time, our team focused on what technique to use for modeling. After classifying groups by gender and age based on the basic analysis, we modeled them using the Apriori algorithm. However, the result was a prize winning failure. Unfortunately, our team did not leave it as a failure, but tried to find the cause of the failure and use it as a springboard for growth. The cause of the failure was that the data processing and exploration analysis had not been properly established due to the lack of data processing and exploration analysis, so I realized that the result prediction rate was lower than that of the winning team. Through the lessons learned from this experience, I tried to analyze thoroughly without neglecting the exploration analysis before doing all the analysis. In addition, in order not to make the same mistakes as before, I worked hard to acquire statistical knowledge, read various papers, participated in the AWS Summit, R Conference, and NDC to understand the current status of analysis in various fields. Based on the efforts made above, I have experience in identifying the behavior of customers who left during the internship process of a commerce company and reflecting them in marketing. After joining the company, I tried various things such as the main indicators used by the company, the customer's purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, the customer's application usability, and purchase analysis. In the process of the above analysis, I found that the main purpose of all analyses at the company was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. At that time, the marketing team was conducting marketing actions to users who left, and I decided to set a clearer text messaging standard for this, so I decided to decide on the subject of the analysis project. First, I tried an exploratory analysis to define the most important departure and how to classify customers. And I analyzed the life cycle of customers based on the Cox PH model by referring to the papers I was interested in at the time. As a result, we identified the timing of departure for new subscribers by characteristics. When marketing to active users, this was used to set the text sending period and increased the text opening rate of target users.This success was possible because, as a result of not neglecting the exploratory analysis, it was possible to define deviations from the exact criteria and classify customer groups. As a result, I was able to proceed with a feasible analysis that was used in actual marketing, not just a task. Analysis is an important field that affects all departments and plans in the company. Therefore, I think the attitude of acknowledging failure and taking it as a lesson is particularly important. The reason I can be here now is because of my attitude to constantly improve based on failure. I hope you remember that I am always challenging and striving to attempt a feasible analysis based on this attitude. The tasks of ""real-life talents, behavioral talents"" have always been successfully accomplished with a sense of responsibility and action. The Golden Bell School Volunteer Group conducted a career education experience that conveyed big data to middle school students through board games. At that time, since it was the first volunteer group, there was a problem that the organization time for game tools was prolonged due to the lack of foundation for progress. To correct this, I carefully observed each class process, found improvements, and immediately reflected them to examine the effect. With the improvements accumulated after several observations and attempts, I was able to reduce unnecessary time and distribute tasks clearly. As a result, the additional organization time was reduced from 40 minutes to 0 minutes. This gave the volunteers the joy of solving problems, and the joy of the volunteers soon led to the student's satisfaction, doubling their impression. These results could come from my behavioral and adaptability. I have always tried to implement any challenges without hesitation. This attitude not only brought about the foundation of the volunteer group, but I was also able to successfully complete the project with quick work adaptability during my internship. I would like to emphasize that this can be demonstrated along with my job skills in my internship activities at Kakao Games, which can further contribute to the creation of the company's value."
"As an analytical consumer, I felt pleasure in analyzing information and delivering it to others. And I dreamed of becoming a data analyst to deliver this joy to customers. I have increased my statistical capabilities to enhance the accuracy of the information to be presented to customers. In addition, I have invested time generously in participating in external activities and contests to utilize them in practice. I thought that a company that will realize my dream is a company that provides opportunities for challenge and innovation for corporate growth and customer impressions. Hanwha Life Insurance is a company that provides opportunity for growth. Currently, Hanwha Life Insurance is leading the life insurance industry by strengthening its capabilities in various fields to create food for the future. Breaking away from the existing business processing method, customers can handle about 70 insurance businesses with just one application. I chose Hanwha Life Insurance because I think the challenge and innovation going forward comes from opportunity for growth in various fields. Big data analysis is an area where opportunity for new fields is especially important. First, I will join a company and extract KPI from its DB. This is because grasping the basic data the company needs and currently uses first is the stepping stone to in-depth analysis results. After that, I will learn and implement machine learning and deep learning through various experiences and learning opportunities provided by the company. Through CS data, we will quickly identify customer complaints and build a system to prevent them. We will build a dataset that can create insurance products that customers really want through insurance data. Through app data, we will improve customer usability and identify behavior to find new food. As a result of these challenges, we will lead the innovation of life insurance companies by planning customized products only for Hanwha Life Insurance customers. My strength is the experience of leading the project and meticulously analyzing large-scale data directly, so that collaborative departments could not recognize that I was an intern. Based on the data I planned, I tried various customer analysis. I tried various attempts, such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, customer app usability, and purchase analysis, and after all analysis, the biggest insight I gained was one. The company found that the purpose of all analysis was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. In general, new users were about twice as likely to leave within a short period of time as existing users. Therefore, it was found that preventing the departure of existing users is an effective strategy in the limited budget rather than attracting new users. Customer departure from insurance can be defined as insurance cancellation in one dimension, but in reality, I think that defining it as the frequency of occurrence of specific actions when the termination date approaches is a sophisticated definition to reduce the dropout rate. As such, I was interested in predicting customer behavior before the incident and reducing customer complaints through prediction, so I chose the field. Based on the previous attempts, we will find the factors that influence customer departure. As a result, we will contribute to the value creation of Hanwha Life by increasing customer satisfaction by preventing departure. ""Strict sense of goal out of responsibility"" When I was a college part-time job, I was in charge of OOO applications to more than 3,000 companies in Seoul. I didn't ask anyone to do it, but I always recorded the company name, number, and delivery information after phone consultation to prepare for misinformation delivery as it was my first time doing a company task. It was my first time in charge of this task, so I felt a lot of pressure and worry, but I worked with strict standards to overcome the pressure with a responsible attitude. First, I looked at the records, explained what I inquired about often and what to note when receiving them, and then organized the details by e-mail again. After that, I checked the documents to see if they were received without errors and called the person in charge of the company. The phone call to thank the company manager for his meticulousness and responsibility became a memorable experience. The passion and responsible attitude for work were the most decisive factors that achieved a document reception error rate of 0% and attracted the satisfaction of corporate customers who visited the industrial complex. Through this experience, I was able to learn not only about meticulousness and responsibility in handling work, but also about relationships with people and harmony with people. I think the above attitude is essential in conducting an analysis based on data. Although it was a trivial experience, the strict sense of goal with responsibility enabled me to tackle challenges that everyone was satisfied with. As a result, I was able to develop many of my own abilities, which soon became my valuable asset and I am still making new assets. Based on the valuable assets I saw and felt in the field, I will bring innovation to the future of Hanwha Life. I have experience in solving problems and successfully leading data projects through communication between the ""Understanding Communication, Adding Value"" collaboration departments. When I was working as an intern at a commerce company, I led a log data design and tagging project. However, during the start of the project, the marketing team and development team, which are the collaboration departments, did not feel the need for the project. So, I tried to communicate with the position of each person in charge to solve this problem. First, I explained the advantages that I would gain from the project. The marketing team explained what can be obtained from the data and what information can be obtained from the development team. And I tried to communicate with the development team and understand the development language, focusing on how the work should be handled to be efficient. Through this process, the collaboration department understood the necessity of work, and understood each other's work methods, thereby increasing work efficiency.As a result of communication with each other, the log data was constructed about two weeks earlier than expected. Although it was a project led by the internship, the attitude of understanding each department and trying to communicate with others became a decisive factor in completing the project successfully. This gave me an opportunity to identify one of my strengths. Through this process, I realized that analysts had to think not only about accurate analysis ability but also about the data and work method required by collaborative departments. Communication is an important factor in the process of creating value through data, and it is the most basic factor in continuing a cooperative relationship with partners in all jobs. I want to add unique value to Hanwha's life through my strengths with solid analysis and communication skills."
"1. Completion Classes - Department Course: Data Mining, Statistical Programming, Data Analysis Theory, Categorical Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Regression - Out-of-school Course: Big Data Social Marketing Professional Training Course (Completion Period: 2016 - 06 - 27 - 2016 - 11 - 11 - 11) - Online Course: T-Academy Big Data Online Course, Coding Night School - Participation in Seminar - APAC Machine Learning, Data Science Community Summit / Enforcement Date: May 20 - Tableau Basic Education / Enforcement Date: June 9 - Watson Explorer Solution for the use of unstructured big data / Enforcement Date: July 25 I have the idea of 'All experiences in life learn' deeply, so I always enjoy passionately challenging myself. On the way to and from school, I always had something in my hand. It was paper with something printed on it, not a cell phone. As I went through the path of an analyst, I thought it was important to understand not only simple theories but also practical applications and current data directions. In addition, I participated in a contest for hands-on training and handled data from various fields. I think the most important thing for an analyst is a challenging attitude to move forward. I want to contribute to the development of modern cards by constantly learning and challenging myself to derive creative insights. 1. Project Topic: Log Data Planning / Data Standardization Personnel: 2 Period January 2017 to March 2017 Role: Data Planning and Project Leading Project Content: Present a guide to the direction of log data accumulation to enable more detailed customer behavior analysis away from Google Analytics. Data structure is consistent for data standardization in Korea, the United States and China. 2. Project Topic: Customer behavior analysis through App/Web reorganization Personnel: 1 Period April 2017 to August 2017 Role of responsibility: Analysis of customer behavior by App Tab Based on the accumulated log data, I took the initiative in the project based on the changed customer behavior analysis through the screen reorganization. When I was working as an intern at a commerce company, I led the project responsibly and meticulously led the collaboration department so that they could not recognize me as an intern. The company attempted to load log data using a segment tool for detailed customer behavior analysis, and led the data planning. Because my plan determines the accuracy of data, the workload of the collaboration department, and the quality of analysis, it was a task that required responsibility above all else. I started communicating with an emphasis on how the development work would be efficient and how to plan it to be more convenient for analysis. At first, I made mistakes because I was inexperienced, but thanks to communicating responsibly, the collaboration department trusted and followed my plan and wanted me to join in the next project. Because the work efficiency of many people was determined by my plan, I worked with a great responsibility, and it was an opportunity to be recognized for my expertise with that responsibility. In addition, I tried various customer behavior analysis based on the data I planned myself. Various attempts were made, such as customer purchase funnel, UX/UI analysis, customer app usability, and purchase analysis, and after all analysis, the biggest insight I gained was one. The company found that the main purpose of all analysis was to attract new users or prevent the departure of existing users. In general, new users were more than twice as likely to leave within a short period of time than existing users. Therefore, it was found that preventing the departure of existing users was an effective strategy in the limited budget rather than attracting new users. Customer departure from the card can be defined as card cancellation in one dimension, but in reality, I think it is a sophisticated definition to reduce the departure rate by defining how long it has passed since the last card payment date. Based on the previous attempts, we will find the factors that influence customer departure. As a result, we will contribute to the company's value creation by establishing a customer's repayment system by preventing departure and improving usability by increasing the active users of Hyundai Card."
"When I was in charge of the project with the theme of ""responsibility to fulfill my role"" corporate security, I collected the opinions of the team members and divided the roles. In the beginning, all the team members faithfully performed their duties, but as time passed, they remained silent. In the end, the completeness of the mid-term inspection was inferior to that of the other groups, and I couldn't even answer the professor's questions. After the presentation, we shared our opinions on the inadequacies. All of the team members said that they lacked the information they needed and were less interested than expected. So, I promoted a corporate tour of a venture company and an IT security company. However, it was rejected because it was an important factor in the life and death of the company. However, I was not discouraged by the failure and started to look for other ways. Just in time, I heard that the World IT Show is holding a special exhibition on industrial security. I was able to meet my team members and solve my questions and have a direct experience with security products and new technologies while conducting an interview with them. I completed the project by building a sense of intimacy and increasing participation in a short period of time. After joining the company, I will use this experience to become a talented person who is responsible for my role. I always plan and proceed with anything, putting importance on the principle of ""insufficient flexibility."" As a result, I hear a lot among my friends that I am well informed. There are many times when things go smoothly with thorough preparation and planning, but when the plan goes awry due to unexpected things, they often get twisted. Therefore, I will increase my flexibility by listening to the people around me. Whenever there is a disruption in the performance of the job, I will come up with a variety of next-line measures by combining the opinions of all members. I will become a talented person who can handle any crisis skillfully and perform successfully. ""Development experience of catching two rabbits"" I learned various programming languages such as C, C++, and Java in each grade, and I became interested in developing and started the Arduino project. I decided to develop a trash can management page because I noticed the problem of trash cans that usually overflowed with trash. I was proud because I did it by myself from purchasing materials necessary for development to building DBs and servers. In particular, the experience of solving the network failure caused by building a server with IP on campus was the most memorable. At that time, professors and seniors also recommended receiving new IP addresses in the computer room. However, I understood the structure of the network and solved the problem by newly designating DNS. As a completed work, I received an A in the development project course, and in conjunction with the classroom wastebasket, I managed to reduce collection costs through efficient management. ""Nothing happens next time."" Whatever I did, I always had lingering feelings. However, it was foolish to have lingering feelings. The report card I received after the SAT was insignificant, and it remained in my mind when I went to college. Eventually, I took a leave of absence from my college and started taking the second try. However, the problem was that I had an insurance policy called leave of absence, not dropout. I lacked the three letters "" sense of urgency,"" and a year becomes a waste of time. After that, I felt the need to drain away whatever happened. To devote yourself only to it, leaving only one option. My first attempt is regret over a ruined first-year subject. Two days before taking the C language test, I exchanged my major books for one meal with my junior. I devoted myself to the test thinking that there was no next time, and as a result, I was able to get an A+. Of course, there were not always good results. However, I am sure that this is the way to do my best. I will always work with the attitude that this is the last one, and I will do my best. I think it is important to put the customer's assets and information first as much as developing a system tailored to the business status of the customer. I want to manage and operate the network and system infrastructure at the contact center and encounter various errors and infringement incidents. I will work hard to establish a security system based on my experience as a system engineer. To this end, I will conduct systematic and continuous information protection activities. I will establish a defense policy by analyzing past hacking cases, subscribe to major security reports such as Cisco, Symantec, and KISA on a regular basis, and acquire new technologies and security information. I will acquire an information security technician within one year after joining the company to improve my ability to check the safety of the built system. Within five years, I will acquire CISSP and CISA to gain international-level security technology capabilities and contribute to acquiring ISMS certification marks. Thus, I will be reborn as the representative security expert of Hanil Networks."
"When I was a child, I hit my head on a stone's throw while riding a bicycle. It was a big accident that could stain my whole body with blood, and after that, I became afraid of the bicycle. Then, last year, I put my foot back on the pedal with a 'some trigger'. I want to talk about overcoming trauma and being able to ride a bicycle again. I took Internet security and built a network using routers. I configured and redistributed dynamic and static routing tables, and built a firewall using Linux. The security network analyzed packets in real time and performed defense activities such as firewall settings and policy settings. In the information security curriculum, I tested and organized Carolynux's simulated hacking tool. In particular, I established security measures by analyzing the results of sniffing and Dos. The UTM equipment set actual web servers and firewall rules and focused on the WAF function. Through log analysis, it was confirmed that Injection and XSS attacks were blocked. Based on solid basic skills, we will perform quick and reliable tasks. In the event of an infringement accident, we will not just end with defense, but analyze the attack and update the operation policy with the acquired security information to ensure the stability of the system. With the know-how accumulated while working for KT, we will be reborn as a leader in security in the upcoming 5G era."
"""Challenge if there is anything you want"" After finishing my first year of university, I have previous experiences. I think it is the result of my skepticism and sincerity about the previous major, which I applied for according to my grades when the SAT exam was over, and my passion to try after knowing what I wanted. I think the first year I was the most passionate and devoted year in my life. It was a year that made me realize that it was the most precious choice in my life. With my passion and momentum, I have been able to focus on my major study well up to now. ""The Value of Together"" I have experience in field training at the National Research Institute during the summer vacation last year. I worked with one of the doctors in charge, and I learned that my doctor was in the same school as me and majored in similar computer science. He taught me the importance of responsibility and willingness to develop in learning and utilizing my major. Even if I finish work late every day, I have a lot of thoughts that if I have a job in the future, I will perform my duties with this person. I was able to learn a lot of practical knowledge while working on programming together, and I think it was a rewarding experience. ""Trust and Patience"" I have experience in office/administrative volunteer work at the Daegu OOOOO Center from September 2016 to March 2017. I went to the center once a week and conducted office work-oriented volunteer work. Mainly, I used the Excel program and Korean programs to manage class attendance and training hours and contents of foreign workers. In addition, when there was a big event in the center, I faithfully volunteered in the lowest position through additional work. It was my first experience while living in a place called work. Experiencing a well-organized position system gave me an opportunity to understand the division of work and the overall process according to positions. Through smooth communication with the people I worked for, I was able to leave a good impression. Through this experience, I realized two things. First, the importance of time commitment. I think it is the most important to keep a good time promise when working. I think sincerity and trust come out when you keep a good time promise. Second, you have to not give up your duties and finish them patiently. I tried to handle the task given to me by meeting the deadline as much as possible. I thought that if the back worker took over the task that I couldn't do, the amount of work could cause me to feel burdened, so I tried my best to handle the task. ""Response to Change, Design for People"" When I was an undergraduate, my interest in and interest in major in programming and database increased. I was able to experience firsthand the way a line of code from my hand makes a difference, and my interest in IT could be amplified. Through this, I was able to think about endless applications and collect information. I have experience working on a comprehensive design capstone design project in the last semester of the fourth grade. The topic of our group's choice is 'Child Protection Area Vehicle Safety Surveillance System'. The convergence of automobiles and IT, and just thinking about it, it was an attractive topic, and I focused on design day and night for a successful project. Eventually, a module that could be demonstrated was completed, and satisfactory results were obtained. Through this experience, I have grown eager to utilize IT knowledge in automobile-related industries in the future. If I go to practice in the future, I would like to work on ERP and database. This is because it is the most closely related to real life and development is possible for people. Based on my major knowledge, I would like to be helpful for the job of automotive computing. Since ""Aiming to a Global Leader,"" Automotive is a global company with 23 production plants and 4 technical research institutes in 9 countries. I tried to develop my global capabilities by constantly learning English and checking foreign materials related to my major. In addition, I was attracted to Automotive's management ideology and applied because it was new and rewarding. After experiencing two field trips and an administrative intern, I was able to think about the value of working together. I want to continue working with automotive by remembering the sense of accomplishment when I get new challenges and rewarding results. As a member of my computer work, I will never stop having strong major knowledge and constant self-development. Changes in the IT field are endless and accelerating with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I will continue to understand the learning and the job in order not to be eliminated. If I join the automotive computing job after ""customer-centered IT planning and operation"", I would like to take charge of IT planning and construction considering the situation of customers and business parties. Big data and the latest IT technologies are pouring in following the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Accordingly, it is necessary to quickly accept information and make appropriate use of it. Through constant self-improvement, I thoroughly learned foreign languages and am exposed to the latest IT-related technologies through regular online news subscriptions. Here, I will make use of my major knowledge to become a talented person with expertise. One year after joining the company, I have experienced two industry-academic and one administrative intern. I will try to adapt quickly, recalling my adaptability and communication skills at that time. For five years after joining the company in the ""10 years after joining the company,"" I will add to my expertise by obtaining an information management technician license. In addition, I will put into practical projects to produce practical results. I will grow into a 10-year middle manager and become an automotive person who is full of humanity, encompassing seniors and juniors."
"""I want to be in charge of stable traffic control at KT, which opens the era of GigaTopia."" It was an indescribable pleasure when I heard the beep sound, which was a successful connection to HiTel by entering ATDT 01410 through a terminal program called 'Story' when I was a child. Due to that influence, I dreamed of a career in the telecommunications industry that connects people and provides convenience to customers. KT was fascinated by the fact that it pioneered the convergence market by announcing five major convergence industries. As the VR and IoT markets are predicted to generate more than four times more traffic, I want to help increase coverage by applying for network jobs where my capabilities can be exercised. ""Two reasons to perform my job well."" 1. While taking the data communication course, I was able to learn the principles of TDMA, FDMA, and WCDMA based on my understanding of the physical layer of OSI 7 layer and TCP/IP protocol. 2. While taking the computer network course, I programmed to count data packets from Ubuntu based on Linux to Gedit. We were able to analyze the packets in Wireshark, see if the NIC needed a MAC address and an IP address, and learn through which algorithms the packets were routed. In order to make the network work better, we will provide convenience to our customers by obtaining server certificates and CCNP and CCIE certificates. Before transferring to ""Learn collaboration through projects,"" I was in charge of a project to build a database to measure overall programming knowledge and literacy using SQL language in the undergraduate computer room. The subject of the project at that time was book management. My task was to build a database, command and supervise. The biggest problem was that we didn't know what we were good at, and the roles were not properly divided. Even if I was busy, I decided to assign more assignments and taught my team members to code basic SQL queries until they were understood. However, the project deadline was approaching, but things didn't go well. I decided to take charge of coding in a new way, judge children's abilities through continuous communication, and take charge of data collection, interview data research, and writing Powerpoint. As a result, everyone was able to get an ""A"" or higher score on the database design project, and I felt that the effort to achieve a common goal doubled compared to when I did it alone. With the theme of ""Seeing the potential as a convergence engineer through the design of graduation works,"" I have implemented graduation works with one master's degree and three undergraduate students, including myself. The reason I chose this method was that, unlike conventional manual systems, users could remotely control it wirelessly. My role was to design the Circuit Orcad by reading the Data Sheet on each chip. When I pressed each button of the cell phone, the signal was a combination of two frequencies, which was to design an input/output control design algorithm from 0 to 7 corresponding to ATMEGA 128 by installing a DTMF chip to convert an analog signal into a digital signal. In addition, we installed an ISD 2560 voice recording chip to record the occurrence of the notice when pressing the button with voice, but noise occurred and we used a program called Voice Ware that converts voice when entering text. However, there was a wide difference between algorithm writing and the actual code, and to solve this problem, we had meetings with graduate students more than three times a week and received feedback on what needed to be improved, but it didn't have much effect. I referred to related cafes and major books but it didn't improve. By analyzing the timing diagram of the clock cycle in a new way, I was able to lower it to the microsecond to complete it. As a result, we were able to achieve the achievement of 'second place in the department'. It was a project to increase the gauge by injecting coins and charging gas. My role was simple to bring about a huge arrangement with shift commands, but I demanded patience because it was repetitive. The problem was that there were difficulties in communication, and there were difficulties in carrying out projects that I often missed even at meetings. We held an SNS meeting to solve this problem. International students had different schedules per language school. I wanted to create synergy, so I decided to share the amount of coding.We were able to take pictures and share each other's progress on SNS and proceed with the project. The project was able to get a 'full score' and I think what I gained was that the attitude of collaborating through analysis was also important. Based on these strengths, I want to contribute to leading the convergence industry with KT, which leads the standardization of 5G."
"""Necessity of security I felt in real life"" As an electronic student, I spent a lot of time using computers for assignments, studies, and team projects. As I downloaded files necessary for development or looked for reference materials from foreign sites, I was often infected with malicious code and found certain sites that kept popping up or slowed down a lot. When I was busy and didn't listen to the computer, I became stressed out. I personally experienced that there is nothing that can't be done without such strict security, and that I'll be under stress that I won't be able to do. In addition, if the security issue is not resolved, services that connect to security are not even available. As I have felt the importance of security in person, I want to study and develop security technology at the best AhnLab in Korea so that I don't get stressed by viruses. Not only that, but I also want to go beyond developing myself, and become a person who knows how to worry about the inconveniences real people have. ""Life-threatening 5G Homework"" With the start of the 5G era, the use of numerous devices will be expanded to include smart homes and smart cities for industrial purposes as the IoT of various sizes becomes possible. However, these 5G services cannot be supported without security certainty. Large-scale devices communicate with each other to collect, analyze, and send feedback because if any one of the processes is not properly guarded, it can have fatal consequences. Malicious attacks on the most popularly anticipated service, 'autonomous car' service, can threaten people's lives if you control the vehicle. Security issues are also very important in terms of the development of 'U-Health-Care', which has the potential to be characterized by 'large-capacity communication' of 5G. From this point of view, I thought I should pay more attention to network security solutions and think about their response. 'Solutions, Steps in the Evil Cycle' Two of the three members, except me, were not interested in coding. I was interested in SW development and was studying it steadily, so it was a little easier to catch a big flow or understand the code. As a result, the progress of the project began to differ, and the members of the group lost more interest, and I became frustrated with the slow progress and became a vicious cycle. I could have just asked them to do it because we divided the roles, but I didn't think it would solve the fundamental problem. Since then, we have met every night and taught our team members how to use basic functions to multi-thread. Therefore, the first progression started slowly, but the team members who have thoroughly mastered the basics have grown by implementing more and more codes, and later on, they have helped me in areas where I had difficulties. Thanks to the step-by-step process without giving up, I was able to achieve A+ grades that only two teams received in this class. If there is something given ""until it doesn't work,"" I will challenge myself until I succeed after experiencing several failures. Although I was tired of studying too much in the semester when I was learning six majors, I did not give up and studied until the dawn without letting go until I realized the contents. Since the 2nd grade when I started learning my major, I have developed and made efforts on my own, and I was able to get a score of 4.5 points in the previous semester. I will become an employee who is helpful in the growth of AhnLab through honesty and persistence toward these goals. ""The ability to cope with experiences"" I think various experiences are important in SW development. This is because I think I grow by encountering various errors, thinking about how to cope with them, and coding by myself. Knowing the importance of experience, I have done various SW projects during my studies. I tried to gain my own experience by developing CRunning games, IoT for the elderly living alone, and posture correction projects, and I was able to learn a lot from this."
"I want to work for a company that can continue to grow and work together in the future without being complacent about the reality of ""Samsung Electronics leading the semiconductor industry."" I applied because I thought that it best fits my company's selection criteria. In order to lead the semiconductor market, I think it is important to increase the performance and power efficiency of semiconductors. To this end, the circuit needs to be refined by continuously expanding production facilities and establishing production lines. Starting with operating a semiconductor line in Pyeongtaek last year, Samsung Electronics has pushed for an investment of more than KRW 37 trillion to expand its production line. This year, we also started the construction of the EUV line in Hwaseong and introduced EUV equipment necessary for micro-processing. Seeing Samsung Electronics' constant improvement, I have confidence that it is the best company to lead the semiconductor industry in the future. ""Planning efficient production and logistics lines and establishing optimal logic"" My dream is to plan production and logistics lines that can flexibly cope with fluctuations in demand and to establish optimal logic to achieve efficiency. I want to use my accumulated simulation experience and data analysis capabilities to plan a line that can respond to changing demand immediately. In addition, I want to lead the smooth flow of the line by properly maintaining the craftsmanship and establishing a logic that evenly produces each step. Through this, I want to contribute to Samsung Electronics' leading the semiconductor industry by maximizing production efficiency. ""Posture of perseverance, which turned frustration into a sense of achievement."" When I was in middle school, I got good grades and went to a private high school. However, upon entering the school, my grades dropped sharply among prominent friends, and I experienced great frustration with the low rank I received for the first time. I decided that I could not remain frustrated in this state, so I set my goal to receive a scholarship for excellent grades and worked steadily. To develop my physical strength, I went to the playground every morning, and first arrived in the classroom to study. When I was discouraged, I tried patiently to achieve a sense of accomplishment, not frustration, by reminding myself of my goals again. As a result, my grades improved the most and I was able to receive two scholarships for excellent grades at school. Through this, I learned that the attitude of perseverance allows me to achieve my desired goals, and I am still practicing this attitude and developing myself. ""Achieving High Completion Through Voluntary Challenges"" University has also been successfully carrying out various projects with a persistent attitude. Among them, the most memorable was the experience of completing a GUI program that mediates safe rooms with Python. It was the most meaningful because it was something I challenged myself to do. I was given a project to design a business model in industrial engineering experiments, so I had the experience of designing a system that mediates safe rooms. I could have stopped at simply designing a project, but I became motivated to implement it with a program myself. I wanted to implement a high-quality system with Python, which I was usually interested in. The system was a system that counts the number of nearby safety facilities such as police stations, convenience stores, and CCTVs through location data, starting with the buildings for sale, and then converts them into safety levels and mediates them from a high ranking. Since I had never used Python before, there were many difficulties in implementing the system. In particular, there was a problem in the part dealing with the GUI program and the part linking the database and Python. However, I did not give up, and I worked patiently to lay the groundwork and strengthen it. In order to improve my lack of programming skills, I first applied for and took a software practice. I wrote various algorithms and laid the foundation by creating calculators myself with GUI programs. After that, I looked for major books and looked for solutions to errors by asking the professor. Through this, I was able to successfully get SQL query statements in Python and complete the program by obtaining safety from processed data. As a result, in a survey on the intention to use the completed program, more than 90% of people answered that they were willing to use it, resulting in meaningful results. Through this persistent attitude, I was able to achieve high-quality project results and further develop my ability to handle Python. I will maintain this attitude even after joining the company, contributing to Samsung Electronics' further growth. ""Necessity of gun control seen through shootings in the United States."" Following Las Vegas in October last year, a number of people were killed in Florida in the United States in February this year. Due to the continuous mass shootings, anti-gun public opinion is strongly formed in the U.S., with gun control campaigns and rallies held. Upon hearing these news, I also sympathized with the feelings of U.S. citizens who want to strengthen regulations as a citizen, and I believe that various laws that strengthen gun regulations should be passed as soon as possible. Currently, President Trump is avoiding citizens' calls for stricter regulations, mentioning only the criminal's mental problems. However, as the president of a country, I think we need to listen to the needs of citizens and public opinion and come up with a plan to collect them. Currently, the National Gun Association (NRA) is being discussed as the biggest reason why gun control cannot be strengthened. The NRA has a great influence on American politics through its sponsorship of politicians. Because of this, politicians sponsored by the NRA have not passed the bill against the bill on gun control. In order to solve this problem, I think the safety of citizens as a citizen of the country should be considered first before politicians in the U.S. think of sponsorship. In the future, I believe that various citizens, including the wealthy, should also become sponsors and consider ways to reduce their influence in response to the NRA's political power. Through this, I believe that legislation to ban the sale of offensive weapons and strengthen the registration of gun vendors and the identification of gun buyers should also be revived.Through these efforts, we hope that gun control in the United States will be strengthened quickly and that there will be no more victims of gun incidents. The system development department ""achieve system efficiency through data analysis and simulation"" is responsible for planning production and logistics lines and implementing optimal scheduling through simulation. Through this, we are operating automated systems efficiently and increasing productivity. I believe that data analysis and simulation skills are necessary to perform these roles. When I was an undergraduate, I developed my skills by working on various projects. I first thought that statistical knowledge was necessary for data analysis, so I took reliability engineering and learned about hypothesis testing. After that, I majored in software engineering and learned database and R data mining, and then applied what I learned by analyzing home sales price data in Regression. Through this, I was able to acquire techniques for collecting and analyzing data, and through statistical knowledge, I was able to select valuable data and verify that the analysis was performed correctly. I have experience in implementing bus-drone delivery systems through simulation in industrial engineering comprehensive design projects in order to improve my simulation skills. The project's topic was to come up with a plan to commercialize the drone delivery system. Our group wanted to commercialize a delivery system that combines a bus and a drone by enabling long-distance delivery and reducing the risk of collision. In order to find a process that minimizes the delivery time of goods after the conceptual design, we set various drone travel routes and simulated them. As a result, we were able to analyze that the route designed in consideration of the receipt time of the goods as a top priority minimizes the total delivery time, and based on this, we completed the bus-drone delivery system. Based on this simulation experience, we will model efficient production and logistics lines. In addition, we will analyze the data and establish an optimal scheduling that can respond to any changes. Through this, we will become employees who contribute to increasing productivity as much as possible by implementing an efficient system."
"I applied because I wanted to join Lotte Information and Communication in becoming an ICT company that leads the future of digital distribution. Currently, Lotte Group is innovating distribution by integrating new technologies by realizing 'intelligent shopping advisor' and 'intelligent decision support platform'. In particular, Lotte Information and Communication is in charge of building an AI-based platform, and the establishment of an IT service that integrates the entire group showed its expertise in big data development. I am interested in big data development, so I have developed my data architect's capabilities by working on a project to build a Hadoop distributed processing platform using AWS. I think the value of the existence of big data is to derive results that can provide beneficial value to everyone. Since distribution is the daily life of all customers, all services provided reach the skin. Therefore, I applied for Lotte Information and Communication, which realized the convergence of customer data and distribution, with confidence that it is a company that can best demonstrate my interest and capabilities. I have built my own career by 'challenging' a new field for my dream. When I was in my second year of college, I was very interested in big data analysis that looked into the future by reading a book called Signal and Noise. I thought that the core basis of big data analysis was to build a platform for storing and processing vast amounts of data, so I dreamed of becoming a data engineer. To this end, I challenged the Java & big data developer training course to start a new field called IT. First, I set my goal to be proficient in Java. I tried to learn about the Java API for the first time through code refactoring and implemented programs such as landmine discovery and multi-chatting. Furthermore, by completing the 'academy management program' Java GUI project and the 'society baseball team website' MVC2 project, I was able to acquire the ability to build Java and various web development languages, Oracle DB, and spring framework. After completing the training, I was very interested in storing and processing big data and immediately started studying Hadoop. I learned MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Hbase in a CentOS-based Linux environment, and grew interest by analyzing vast amounts of data such as Seoul bus rides and U.S. aviation data. Based on the learned knowledge, I built a Hadoop cluster using AWS EC2 and am currently learning Scala by working on an EMR-based Spark MLib project. I want to grow into a data engineer who has secured expertise in decentralized and parallel processing architecture by setting goals and demonstrating my strengths in constantly challenging them. I have been a math mentor for nearly three years at a boarding academy, and I have set and implemented a goal to get all of the students in charge to the desired university. While working for a year, I found two problems. First, it was the students' lack of motivation for learning. It was due to poor grades because they did not know how to learn effectively. Also, it was an inefficient teaching method that only conducted scoring and correcting without considering individual levels. I thought that correct learning methods and customized classes would be helpful. So, I set a goal of 'let's allow more students to enter the university they want' through the improvement of the system. To this end, I suggested the direction of improvement to the director. First, in order to teach them the correct learning method, they did not stop solving problems, but always explained 'why' and emphasized logical connection relationships. In addition, we made the solutions by type by hand and helped them to apply them easily. Next, we proposed a customized method to classify them into students who need supplementary classes and those who want simple solutions. The director gladly accepted and delegated all of the students' management authority. As a result, 6 out of 8 candidates in charge increased their grades by more than 10 points and received a grade improvement by two notches. Unfortunately, we did not achieve a dramatic result of going to the university that everyone wanted, but we were able to set a clear career path and have a motivation to learn. With the goal of students going to college, I felt an unforgettable sense of accomplishment as I agonized, moved passionately, and struggled to help. While performing my work, I will always set goals, think about better ways, and challenge myself. Through 'active communication' with my team members, I have experience of successfully completing the daily precipitation prediction project in Seoul. In order to secure the disk space required for the installation of the Hadoop cluster, I was able to think of AWS that rents the capacity virtually, away from the traditional method of using VMware through constant communication with the team members. Together, we collected academic materials and made a manual to learn EC2, and whenever errors occurred in security groups, IP settings, and putty accesses, we always looked for 'why' and looked for solutions. Finally, we were able to complete all the targeted functions by allocating enough capacity to build a cluster. Through this, we achieved two fruits. First, I learned that new insights can be created when many thoughts gather, not alone. I thought of AWS by sharing my opinions on the limitations of the existing method. In addition, I felt the importance of communication by introducing a new environment called EC2. I was able to quickly find and correct errors that occurred by actively asking and giving advice to each other. On the other hand, there were cases where I messed things up due to 'excessive motivation'. From the experience of giving up specialized Data Science education, I learned that excessive motivation can damage the organization. I did not have enough time to participate in the training while working on other projects, so I was not able to fulfill my role. I studied with the help of my team members, but I eventually quit the training because I was pushed by the deadline for the project that I was working on. Since then, I have been trying not to reverse my failure by organizing my schedule on a weekly basis and completing my work according to my priorities. I want to become a data engineer who contributes to the commercialization of all online and offline stores of AI services by establishing DW and data marts that integrate the entire data of Lotte Group.To this end, I thought that the absorption power of new technologies is the most important quality, so I have been interested in the latest IT trends. In order to gain understanding of big data, I acquired an ADsP certificate and learned statistical techniques and R programming. In addition, with my interest in fintech, I have attended fintech conferences, listened to trends and prospects of new technologies such as AI and blockchain, and practiced interest into action. Recently, I have been very interested in L.POINT big data platform, Lotte Members' Hadoop-based analysis parallel system. After joining the company, I will secure expertise by learning open source technologies such as Spark and Zepplin for real-time collection of data. So, we will develop a platform that can collect, process, and analyze not only structured data in real time, and expand it to more customers to lay the foundation for AI innovation."
"""Step for Fintech Professionals"" I applied to Hyundai AutoEver to achieve my dream of becoming a fintech expert. I was deeply fascinated by the process called big data analysis, which discovers meaningful values from the list of meaningless data, and the algorithms inherent in it. Since then, I have taken my major course, Financial Mathematics, and I have a desire to apply mathematically organized theories to financial data. I completed the Java & Big Data Developer Training Course, and through two projects, I developed my web development and IT practical skills. And I gained insufficient statistical capabilities by learning the knowledge of data analysis and how to use R through online and offline lectures. At the Hyundai AutoEver recruitment briefing held by the school, I heard from the HR manager that it is a company with many educational opportunities. I want to learn various data analysis skills such as Hadoop at AutoEver and grow into a fintech expert. That's why I want to be a member of Platform Management of the Big Data Analysis Platform and show my passion. During the development of the MVC2 project, I participated in SW-tech specialized training on Data Science. I studied hard by asking my team members, but I had difficulties that continued in the project, and I had no choice but to concentrate my time. Moreover, I clearly felt the limitations of non-majors in the logistic regression analysis of data machine learning. Eventually, I was forced to give up education due to the deadline. I gave up because I was so disappointed in myself. However, I felt that if I gave up like this, I would not be able to do my job properly wherever I went. Immediately after the project was announced, I started studying data and statistics program R from the beginning through online lectures and professional books, looking back on the situation at the time. I was able to increase my data analysis capabilities by converting my hard memories into a catalyst for development. Through this experience, I developed the ability to think of it as an opportunity to take a new leap forward no matter how hard things go. The biggest advantage is that the positive attitude of ""activity vs excessive motivation"" is. When sharing project roles based on the Java GUI, the server was more complex than other functions, so no one was willing to come forward. So I volunteered and stayed up all night in front of the computer for a few days, eventually completing the server in three days. As I have done so far, I will lead everything I will take charge of after joining the company and do my best to become an autoever. On the other hand, excessive motivation is my weakness. I often took on tasks outside of my ability, which often caused complicated plans or disruptions in my schedules. That is why I have made it a habit to complete the most important tasks in turn by filling out a priority list. As a new employee who completes his/her duties smoothly and strives to self-care, I will become a mainstay who contributes to Autoever. Convergence talents have three competencies. First, I have developed my ability to use formulas and graphs and mathematical thinking skills using MATLAB through numerical analysis and applied mathematics, which are my major subjects. Then, I learned various object-oriented languages including Java, and came to fruition as the Spring MVC2 project. I have developed R data analysis language ability and analysis and insight into data. By combining the three competencies well, I will establish myself as a differentiated developer. ""Eye to examine the world"" I have developed my ability to understand global economic trends. On campus, I have developed basic concepts through economics classes. Externally, I have completed an international economic expert course organized by the Korea Institute of Finance and have developed the ability to read the flow of the global economy. Based on these experiences, I have developed the ability to analyze businesses that accurately grasp the needs of customers in each country. As a developer with economic insight, I want to take the lead in global growth."
"CJ has led numerous success stories with its various technologies in broadcasting/media. CJ Group has many affiliates and has shown success in various fields, and it was an attractive company for me, who wanted to learn more about flexible and broad work. In particular, I applied for this job with a company called CJ Olive Networks because CJ's values and mine matched. It was very attractive to me that CJ's values that value cooperation and various experiences are in sync. CJ Olive Networks is a global ICT company that has led successful IT projects in various fields based on these values. Therefore, I want to join CJ Olive Networks and participate in in information technology service and system work in various media fields directly. I always liked dealing with computers since I was young, and I have never done that in other subjects, but I wanted to learn more about computer classes because my parents begged me. Since then, I have tried to learn anything, including words, documentary practice, HTML, and web editor. Since then, my dream has already been decided as a programmer in the information and communication field. The various strengths that I have prepared for my job are as follows. First, I strengthened my expertise by taking various programming-related classes such as C, Java, and MS-SQL, and I achieved satisfactory grades. And I tried to strengthen my expertise by studying variously regardless of my major field. Second, I worked on several projects while taking these programming courses. I have experience in various projects such as building a book management database, creating an online shopping mall based on HTML/CSS, and playing number baseball games. Third, I analyzed packets and designed county programming based on Linux with WireShark while taking a computer network course. Solid expertise and diverse experience based on this major knowledge will lead to more efficient solutions to job performance. ""I want to work with CJ Olive Networks to realize customer satisfaction."" CJ estimates the domestic IT service market share of the domestic IT service market at about 1.5%. In addition, due to clouding services, the IT business in the domestic market is showing limitations of growth, and as of 2016, I thought that the sales cost of the SM business division dropped sharply compared to last year. I judged that it was important to maintain sales in Korea anymore. I will keep the share of SM business free sales at 10% throughout 2025. I'll explain two capabilities for this. First, I've developed an attitude of leading by example and collaborating. In the database practice project, my mission was to build a database, command and supervision. I didn't know what to do when I was lacking and started the project. In order to solve this problem, they taught me to code basic SQL queries until I understood them. However, the project deadline was approaching, and things didn't go well. In a new way, I decided to be in charge of coding, and I was willing to stay and do it. It changed whether there was anything I could do to help you with. The effort to achieve a common goal has doubled compared to when I was alone. Second, I have developed a sense of responsibility. As a student who manages three computer labs, I have played a role in coordinating between students and the school. The school has adhered to the policy of free printing for students to study, but their rights have been abused. In order to instill a sense of ownership in the students, I suggested an amount of 10 won per page, and the children did not accept it at first, but they continued to persuade me to agree. The school was able to reduce print maintenance costs by 200,000 won per month. Based on these capabilities, I want to become a culture-leading CJ Ein. ""See as an engineer through the design of graduation work."" I once implemented the graduation work 'The Ubiquitous System' with one master's degree and three undergraduate students, including myself. The method I used was that I could directly control the system by receiving the 'mobile phone button'. The existing system manually pressed the button to control the system, but the reason I chose this method was that the user could wirelessly control the distance directly. When I first took charge of designing the graduation work, everyone was busy with the employment season, so there were many cases of scheduling deviations and the work was very slow because they did not understand the sectors that each other could do well. However, I returned the weekend, identified the sectors that we knew each other well, and divided the tasks to proceed with the project. The department I was confident in designed Circuit as Orcad by reading the Data Sheet of each part's chips. The signal generated when pressing each button of the mobile phone was a signal that combines two frequencies. It was to design an input/output control design algorithm from 0 to 7 that corresponds to ATMEGA128 by installing a DTMF chip to convert an analog signal into a digital signal. In addition, the ISD2560 voice recording chip was installed to record the occurrence of a notice when pressing a button with voice, but noise occurred and a program called VoiceWare was used to convert the voice when entering text. However, there was a wide difference between algorithm writing and the actual code, and by analyzing the timing of the clock cycle, we were able to match the microsecond to complete it. As a result of continuous communication and collaboration, we were able to complete the graduation work faster than expected and achieve the result of 'second place in the undergraduate department'. Based on this experience, as a member of CJ Olive Networks, we will identify each other's strengths, prioritize them according to the nature of the work, and support them by allocating tasks. I will become a talented person who can achieve results based on passion that does not give up easily."
"""I'd rather die than live without passion."" In 2014, when I served in the military as a compulsory police officer, I was passionately into something. I was given a position called ""Sumu"" with about three months left after my discharge from the military, and I was responsible for writing documents such as out-of-town activities of the platoon members, the status of the number of dispatched personnel, and the organization of branch representatives in the event of a situation. I've been working as a clerk for about a week, but I thought there were many inconveniences. Due to the nature of the compulsory police, there were frequent dispatch due to sudden situations, but there was a problem that the dispatch time was delayed because it took too long to enter the divisional representative or the status of the number of dispatched personnel. So for a few days, I was wondering, 'How can I shorten the time to write documents?' As a result, I decided to use Excel technology I studied to obtain a certificate, and I decided to make it using a macro function so that all other documents were automatically written down only when the names of the platoon members and the situation of out-of-town activities were written down. Unlike the rest of the members who were off after returning from the night shift or after the situation, I divided my time into one 'passion' to finish it quickly and help the platoon, spending the night and night, and completed it over about a month. In the process, I exchanged a lot of feedback with the platoon members to make better programs. When I worked with the completed program, it was really comfortable, and in fact, the time to write documents was significantly reduced in the event of a situation, and I felt that the dispatch time was accelerated. I was very proud and happy that the program I passionately made could help the platoon. Also, after a few years of discharge, I received several calls saying thank you and that I am still using the program I made, and it was great to hear that. I want to become an intern who is recognized for my ability as a developer at NCsoft by demonstrating my tenacity. When I was in my second year of college, I was interested in the app when I took a lecture called 'Java Application Programming'. Since then, I have purchased books related to Android app development and studied app development technologies, and when I don't know anything, I have grown myself by asking questions on developer sites such as OKKY and Devpia. Now that I have studied app development technologies, I want to actually develop an app. So after thinking about it, I decided to participate in the 'OOO Contest' with my schoolmates and seniors. After several idea meetings, I decided to create an 'IoT Fire Detector' using IoT technology. My role was to develop and design mobile apps, and until the project proceeded, I was worried about 'whether I could actually make the app that I used all the time'. I was also worried about 'can I win the competition with others who already know how to develop apps?' However, when I actually developed the app, I went to the library to read related books, asked questions on the developer site, and overcame the difficulty in carrying out the project by obtaining the necessary information. I found and learned the skills necessary for app development on my own, and I was able to feel a sense of accomplishment when I worked up all night to implement the desired functions. As a result, my overall understanding of the Android app development process and my skills in app development improved, and I was able to get an opportunity to display it at the expo after winning the election. Through participation in this contest, I was able to gain practical development experience in mobile app programming. Not only that, but I realized that it is very important to keep thinking about how to approach it conveniently and efficiently for real users. Since then, I wanted to improve my skills by doing everything by myself, not only client development, but also DB design and construction, and server development, which are the technologies necessary to develop apps. So, I am currently producing a smoking detection helper in a non-smoking area using Raspberry Pi as my graduation work. I am learning how to build and manage a DB using MySQL and PhpMyAdmin, and I am developing a server using PHP and JSP. In addition, I have actually linked Raspberry Pi to the server and DB, and I have linked the server and the app to the server and DB, and I am almost in the completion stage. Through this graduation work, I feel proud that the overall skills and understanding required for app development have improved, and I will learn more about various technologies related to app development from now on. In addition, I am learning Kotlin, which is spreading rapidly, and I am planning to create an app using Kotlin to respond quickly. I am a ready developer who can fully realize the capabilities NCsoft needs. Through this NCsoft internship program, I want to learn experiences that cannot be learned through books and gain practical skills. ""The great ones have a purpose, and others have wishes."" My goal is to become the most professional talent in my development job and become an indispensable person within the department. I think it is the process of adapting to and learning the company by one year after joining the company. I will try to learn from the seniors who are the best experts and adapt to the company. After I finish adapting, I will do my best to improve my application development skills first. As Google adopted Kotlin as the official language of Android in May last year, the company is gradually developing apps using Kotlin, and NCSoft is also looking for talented people who have knowledge about Kotlin, and I thought that they are working on various projects using Kotlin. I am also learning Kotlin now, and after joining the company, I will build enough knowledge to make apps using Kotlin without difficulty. Also, when new technologies or languages are introduced, I will not hesitate to learn and help other employees. Second, I will improve my language skills.I heard that NCsoft is expanding its mobile game business in Asia, such as Pangya Mobile and Lineage M. Among them, Japan, which succeeded in Lineage 2 as well as the size of the market, is considered an important base for NCsoft. Currently, I am preparing to obtain a JLPT level 2 certificate, and I want to improve my Japanese language skills so that I can be very helpful in communication when working on Japanese services."
"""I will do my best in the manufacturing SI field."" I visited the IT consultation booth at the JobFestival held on campus last year. I met two senior IT development graduates who are incumbent in the SI field. I heard negative opinions about the oversaturated SI industry, but they advised me that the SI industry, which assists the manufacturing industry, which is Korea's growth engine, has a future orientation. Later, I learned about Miracom I&C's manufacturing IT service business. To learn more about these industries, I met with current employees in the industry and found out that my capabilities can be helpful for Miracom I&C's development job. I tried to develop the three competencies necessary for the SW job, and I will apply them to the practice. First, it is development competency. I took JAVA course in web programming and developed 'JSP-based travel sharing community site' as a team project. I was in charge of web design and member database construction of the project. Through this, I developed JAVA language and system development capability. Second, physical strength. During the military service in the computer room, I maintained consistent physical strength by working in two shifts in group 4, answering the phone, and 150 hours of internal and external activities. Third, it is analysis ability. While taking the database course, I designed the 'Hospital Database'. I was able to develop logical analysis ability by setting and printing 20 work process scenarios that could occur in the hospital. ""Activity-Pose to Fill the Shortcomings"" After entering the Department of Computer Engineering, I participated in the 'This is the Java Competition' and set a challenging goal of completing the first project. In the process of achieving these goals, I was very helpful in enhancing the activeness of learning and in how to approach problem solving. When I was a freshman in college, I planned a project to implement 'JAVA-based ATM' at the 'This is the Java Competition'. I aimed to execute the event on that button by using the account creation login, main page and deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons. However, because DB and JSP learning were not available, there was a situation where the login function based on the member data design could not be coded. I tried to solve this problem as follows. I reviewed the development process of the 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system' through the completion of short-term JSP and DB lectures by IT institutions and Google search. In this process, I found that creating a DAO class, a module that communicates with the DB, and a DTO class, an object used to store individual data elements, was the solution to the login problem. By applying this, I completed the completion and submission, and I have grown into a patient figure who actively solves problems. In the graduation project, which I conducted for 10 months, I presented ideas by demonstrating teamwork and finally realized the results. I encountered two difficulties in the process. The first is the idea planning. Taking advantage of the high issue of fine dust, we planned an app with two team members to measure the value of fine dust, display the measurement area as a Google map, and graph the values. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing dust measuring stations. After three meetings with the team members, I thought about attaching a dust sensor to the drone, breaking away from the method of measuring in a fixed place such as a measuring station. As a result, the plan was carried out after the professor's inspection three times. The second is the departure of the team member. During development, the team member who was in charge of the UI of the app left, and I thought positively and accepted the reality. I took over the source that the departure team member worked on and reallocated the work. There were cases where I stayed up all night due to an increase in working time, but as a result, it was completed within the deadline."
"""Looking at it with an open mind"" I like to socialize with people. Especially, when I was in elementary school, I liked group activities such as winning second place in a team event at a local swimming competition, and showing demonstration by being selected as a group demonstration team at the OOO kendo competition. Since then, I have interacted with people in internal and external activities during my college days. In the process, I focused on how much I cooperated and communicated with people in those activities. As a result, when the activities were over, I was told by my team members that I was a mood maker, and it was the best thing to hear throughout the activities. ""Conversing with Students in Computer Language"" One week before the opening of my first year of university, there was a program that supported students to learn C language in advance by the school's software project group. It was a great opportunity to learn C language for one week. I was not interested in computer language until I entered university, so I completed the pre-learning, and in the first semester of my first year, I got the result that I showed a beverage vending machine in the console window using a visual studio in a class called programming language and practice. I built up my knowledge by learning my major subjects such as programming application, data structure, and Linux, and I wanted to use them to help students who are interested in IT. So, I have been doing IT volunteer education outside of my second year of university for elementary and middle school students. Using Albert Robot and a Corduroy game program produced by Microsoft, I did activities to improve students' algorithm learning ability. After the activities were over, I answered that I was grateful that the students easily explained the difficult contents at their own level. I was happy to be able to help others based on the major I learned during my college life. With this opportunity, I decided to improve my development ability and provide easy-to-use services for many people. ""Important Customer-Centered Non-face-to-face Channel Services"" As the 4th Industrial Revolution enters, the proportion of non-face-to-face transactions with customers is increasing. In the past, customer behavior was carried out in line with the work process performed at financial branches. However, with the growth of non-face-to-face channel services such as online and smartphones, the work process is now changing around customer behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to make communication with customers commonplace and provide services tailored to customers' needs at the time and in a way that customers want through extensive data analysis on them. Hana Financial TI is focusing on laying the foundation for fintech by establishing FinK, a joint venture between SK Telecom and fintech, to develop artificial intelligence services in line with this trend of customer-centered change. After joining the company, I want to highlight the advantages of the financial business system developed by Hana Financial TI and contribute to ensuring that employees and customers of customer companies who use the business system are not uncomfortable by finding improvements. ""I tried to gain practical experience."" I did not neglect my major learning even though I engaged in various external activities. Through learning my major, I have acquired theoretical knowledge and applied it. Using HTML and JSP learned in web programming classes, we created a bulletin board site that implements login, membership, and writing functions and builds a member database. Through this work, I have gained basic knowledge of the web. Based on these experiences, I worked on HTML modifications such as pop-up and image banners on the intranet for two years in the OO computer room. In addition, by applying the SQL statements learned in the database subject to the Toad tool, the military intranet ID was created, modified, and deleted. After being discharged from the military, I became curious about the management of private companies' websites, so I was in charge of maintaining and maintaining the in-house website using EditPlus in summer field training. This helped me gain practical experience in managing the web system established through this. There is a part of Hana Financial TI's work that manages the computer system within the group. Since each affiliate's website exists, I want to be helpful in managing it. Once you set a goal for ""talent demonstrating sustainable passion,"" you achieve it with all your passion. When I was a third grader in college, when I was taking the embedded subject, I set a goal to calculate a finished product applying theory. At that time, drones were so popular that I proceeded with a project to control drones with controllers using Arduino boards with my team members. I was in charge of planning and C language coding. It was my first time encountering this work, and I had difficulty in proceeding with the code part that controlled the center of gravity of the drone. To solve this problem, I contacted the drone production community operators, and they directly took the drone parts and assembled them with them. In addition, I visited the embedded professor once a week for two months and asked for advice on how to apply the Arduino open source and the pitch, roll, and yaw codes that control the center of gravity. As a result, the drone was assembled perfectly, and later, it was successful to float the drone more than 5m above with the right center of gravity. Through this process, I was able to understand the C language-based theory more accurately. It was also an experience where I gained important knowledge to combine hardware and software. ""We will show you accurate problem diagnosis and practice."" Good developers should have the ability to accurately analyze problems and correct them. As a project, two team members decided to create an app that measures the value of fine dust using a fine dust sensor and a GPS sensor, and displays the measured area in Google Maps. The core of this project was to load the numerical values generated by fine dust sensors into the Android app without any problems. I discussed it with my team member and found that the Wi-Fi shield is compatible with other devices. However, when it is out of the Wi-Fi range, the Wi-Fi shield failed to import the numerical value properly. As a result, I experienced the inconvenience of having to modify it every time with the SSID and password of the Wi-Fi or network provided by another environment.It wasn't easy to replace the Wi-Fi shield we were working on because the interim presentation of the project was only about a week away. With me as the team leader, all the team members uploaded questions to the Arduino community using the information they knew, and we got information that replacing it with a Bluetooth module is convenient to use in any environment and the length of the code will be simplified. Before I bought the module, I tested it in advance with the module you have. As a result of the test, I heard the fine dust value well even when I was moving. With accurate judgment, we completed the parts replacement and app production before the interim presentation. ""We will handle it quickly."" When I worked overtime in the OO computer room, there was a blackout for about 30 seconds in the morning due to bad weather. I learned how to deal with power outages from my senior, so I quickly reported and created a time table. I also went into the computer room server room and checked the status of the web, WAS, DB server, switch, and router, and checked whether UPS was working properly. I completed all reports and inspections, and the next day, I handed over the work safely. I was embarrassed because it was the first power outage I experienced while working, and I was working alone. However, I regained my composure and handled the work quickly according to the manual. This year, Hana Financial TI established the Hana Financial Group Integrated Data Center, which integrates the human and material information technologies of all affiliates in the group. If I become an employee of Hana Financial TI and take charge of managing the server infrastructure, I will try to get used to my work based on my experience in managing the server in place."
"""Work Improvement Activities Using ICT"" I was very attracted to the job of developing and operating ICT, which has already entered our daily lives and is changing our way of life by connecting people and things in various industries such as construction, automobiles, and security. In particular, through the internship, I was able to think about various things about ICT that satisfies the security of important documents of a company and the convenience of performing tasks. I participated in the 'Smart Office Establishment' project to create an efficient work environment using ICT technology. At the idea meeting, we proposed the introduction of a cloud system. I thought that if the information on the work PC is uploaded to the cloud server without storing it on the hard disk, it has the advantage of being able to maintain information security from USB and hacking e-mail infected with malicious code, and perform work anywhere without being restricted by space. The idea received positive reviews and is in the stage of applying it to a real work environment. I have experience of producing positive results through cooperation with incumbent people through talent donation ""Cooperation is the best way to achieve goals."" As an electronic circuit design project, I produced a temperature alarm system. I was in charge of designing a circuit that measures temperature, divides it into three areas, displays it as an LED, and informs it as a BUZZER. The first work I produced did not implement the designed operation. The process of designing and producing a circuit without anyone's help, selecting a device, and producing it was a battle of errors. In order to solve the problem, I requested a talent donation from OOOOOOOOOO, and I was able to get advice from an incumbent electronics manufacturer to solve the problem. Based on that advice, after correcting several errors, I was able to create a work that perfectly embodies the function I was aiming for and received an A+ grade. Rather than thinking of taking everything by myself and solving it, I learned that it is easier and farther away by actively using the people and opportunities around me. We prepared the 'Electric Vehicle Production Competition' by forming an alliance with the mechanical engineering department ""Active Position"". However, due to unexpected circumstances, it became impossible to participate in the competition. This caused a conflict with a team member of the mechanical engineering department. Although it was not a conflict that occurred due to my fault, I asked for an apology and understanding on behalf of the club, and suggested that our team members be dispatched in turns to help prepare for the competition. As a result, I was able to resolve the conflict. I will actively solve the problem situation that may occur in the process of the ICT project before anyone else. ""Disposedness of milk"" It has the disadvantage of spending a lot of time thinking about results and problems that can be planned and predicted before performing something. Deadline is being set to compensate for these shortcomings. I think that these shortcomings can be used to perform more planned and mistake-free tasks by subdividing, predicting, and analyzing the task performance process. I know that communication with department members is the most important task in a company composed of team units of ""The Importance of Communication and Cooperation"". I was able to report on the progress of the work and learn the attitude of actively asking for help in areas in need. I think that the method of collaborating and communicating with the basic skills of organizational life learned through internships will be helpful in planning and improvement activities for ICT projects. ""Major Knowledge and Problem Solving Ability"" I majored in control measurement engineering and applied my major knowledge to my work through temperature alarm devices using temperature sensors, serving robots using infrared sensors and Bluetooth communication, and electric vehicles. In the process, I was able to develop my problem-solving ability through various and constant attempts to reduce errors and defects in project planning and execution ability and performance. I think I can smoothly carry out the new ICT development and project of Hyundai AutoEver using my major knowledge."
"""Woori Bank Becoming a Financial IT Company"" I visited the financial counseling booth at the Job Festival held on campus last year. I met a senior who is currently working at a financial company. In the process of receiving counseling, I was told about the vision of financial IT. After that, I experienced 'WiBitok' and 'WiBibank' in person to confirm my business expansion for fintech solutions and I wanted to work for Woori Bank, which is constantly challenging the fintech market. I tried to develop the three competencies that IT employees need. First, development competency. I took the web programming and JAVA courses and developed 'JAVA and JSP-based travel sharing community site' as a team project. I was in charge of web design and membership database of the project. Through this, I developed JAVA language and system development capabilities. Second, physical strength. During the military service in the computer room, I maintained constant physical strength that did not get tired of work by working in 4 groups of 2 shifts, responding to phone calls, and going backpacking for a month. Third, it is analysis ability. While taking the database course, I designed the 'Hospital Database'. I was able to develop my logical analysis ability by setting and printing 20 work process scenarios that could occur in hospitals. I will become a passionate employee by applying these capabilities to my job. I encountered two difficulties in the team's goal of completing the ""Think differently, finish until the end"" graduation project. First, it is an idea planning. With the high issue of fine dust, we planned an app with two team members to measure the value of fine dust, display the measurement area in Google Maps, and graphically represent the values. However, the professor evaluated that there was no difference from existing dust measuring stations. Through three meetings after that, he thought of attaching a dust sensor to the drone, breaking away from the method of measuring in a fixed place such as a measuring station. Through the drone control, he was able to get the value of dust in the area he wanted to check. As a result, the plan was carried out after three inspections by the professor. Second, it was the departure of the team member. During development, the team member who was in charge of the UI of the app left the team. At first, I was embarrassed, but as a team leader, I quickly took over the source the team members worked on, allocated the work with the team members, and completed it within the deadline. Through this, it was a valuable experience to think differently from the existing method through idea planning and overcome the difficulties encountered in the process of implementing it. ""Activity - Attitude to fill the deficiencies"" The experience of the 'This is the Java Contest' greatly helped in enhancing the activeness of learning and in how to approach problem solving. When I was a freshman in college, I participated in the 'This is the Java Contest' and planned a project to implement a 'Java-based ATM'. I aimed to execute the event on that button by using the account creation login, main page and deposit, remittance, and balance check buttons. However, because DB and JSP learning were not done, there was a situation where the login function based on the member data design could not be coded. I tried the following to solve this problem. Through the completion of short-term JSP and DB lectures by IT institutions and Google search, we developed a 'JSP-based university lecture evaluation system'. In this process, we learned that the solution to the login problem is to create a DTO class, an object used to store individual data elements, in 1:1 correspondence with the DAO class and DB table, which are modules that actually communicate with the DB. By applying this, the completion and submission were completed, and it has grown into a patient figure who actively solves problems. ""Acting silently instead of convenience"" At the time of field training for small and medium-sized enterprises in educational institutions, the CEO gave four trainees the task of creating an NCS curriculum platform for three industries: IT, distribution, and electricity. However, during the production process, the CEO was asked to consider and write various examples on his own when there was a work to list examples and examples of how to write NCS-based self-introduction letters. Several trainees searched the Internet for information about case writing from the middle of the work period, copied and pasted it as it was, and shortened the time. I was also shaken by such temptation, but in the end, even if it took more time to work, I came up with all the examples and wrote them. It might seem silly to others, but I didn't think it was a loss to adhere to the principles with conviction. After that, when I received the final inspection from the CEO, all of the trainees obtained the same result of passing without much criticism. However, I think I maintained the correct attitude by following the principles in that I handled things without using expedients. ""I will experience it more fiercely."" In the short term, I will try to understand and carry out the general employee cycle, such as reception and credit work that I have not experienced through sales work after joining the company. We will increase our adaptability to situations that may occur at customer contact points by utilizing the experiences of communicating and persuading various people from elementary school students to the relevant activity manager in internal and external activities. In addition, based on the knowledge of finance that we have learned steadily on the corporate and bank research websites and the experience of selling veggies on the street and increasing the sales rate by 80% in OO Bank's external activities, we will apply this to the sale of Woori Bank's financial products. In the long run, I will be an IT employee who takes the lead in enhancing the planning power and security of WEB and APPs used by Woori Bank. With the recent release of APPs using new IT technologies such as big data and AI, the use of services incorporating these new IT technologies will be used as part of everyday life in the future. We will become an employee who plans IT services that are difficult for customers to understand more easily and increases security through information protection, big data utilization, and attending security-related seminars that have been completed at universities."
"I have grown through experience. In particular, learning in the college major became more and more curious as the more I tried, the faster I understood and learned. While working on the lab project, I personally felt that the contents I learned through the experience remained easier and longer, and I have tried and tried to learn new things in various ways since then. Also, reading was at the center of my growth. And I wanted to be like a book to others and share my comfort. So, if there is someone around you who cannot adapt or lag behind in work, I tried to be the first to help. For example, during my internship activities, there was a team member who could not keep up with the speed due to lack of individual competency. Fortunately, there is a case in which a project was successful by researching and studying together to provide the maximum help and lead. After the internship activity was successfully completed, I was able to feel the value of solidarity and harmony among the team members. The biggest advantage of my personality is that I have a strong sense of responsibility, consideration, and a strong spirit of challenge. My biggest strength is that I have a meticulous and sincere personality through constant reading, so I keep calm. Because of this, I lacked some quickness. To overcome this, I volunteered to present team projects, answered unexpected questions, and made efforts to develop contingency. When I was in college, I participated in an academic conference and experienced limitless efforts. The thesis was about a new technology, but it was very difficult at the time. I was troubled with a delay of about two weeks from the schedule. However, as a result of constant persistence and persistence, I was finally able to find a solution. I immediately acquired the necessary background knowledge and immersed myself only with passion and persistence. I was able to recognize the concept that the subject was applied using some of the existing things, and through this, I was able to properly transform it and finally complete it. As a result, I was able to complete it within the period and reduced the worries of the two weeks that had been delayed. This created an opportunity to experience the limit of effort for me. It gave me a foothold to grow by strengthening my persistence and tenacity, and furthermore, I developed a sense of adventure and challenge. Since then, I have tried and tried to learn new things in various ways. I looked at the news from time to time to understand the trends, attempted to utilize them appropriately, and was able to play a big role in the process of coming up with ideas and finding ways to improve them. In this way, we will contribute to the company, not to individuals, by examining and analyzing trends that can contribute to the company's development."
"With my endless passion for learning and challenges for new things, I have built my own competence up to this point. After being discharged from the military, I worked harder to study the department, actively asked questions to the professor, and to find out what I didn't know, I went through a scholarship throughout the school year. I was interested in Japanese other than English, so I studied on my own to obtain JLPT N2. And, using my experience as a library manager in the military, I worked part-time on weekends at a city library for a year after discharge, and I learned how to respond to customers and think from their perspective. In addition, for the past three years, I have worked for weeks by musicians while producing album covers as a hobby. Furthermore, by joining a book club and participating in related events, I developed speech to express my thoughts. Until I came here, it was a process that I have been honing and cultivating for the present. Even if I can't produce results right away, if you trust me and keep watching, I will show you good results on the S/W test. There was a problem with the game experience board that was being produced during the fourth-year college graduation project, but obviously, there was a problem that the enemy did not die because the parts (character movement + enemy processing) were combined. And because I didn't know exactly where the problem was, I spent the day looking for errors in that code. What I felt after this day is that QA is important in any aspect. At the company level, it is the final gateway to releasing great products, so it is necessary to carefully review them from the user's point of view, and in the process, a logical explanation is also required to mediate between the developer and the management. To do this, a variety of knowledge about the project is also required. Reflecting on this, in future projects, I always annotate parts that are difficult to think of in the middle of production, or documented and recorded the production process in detail. Through this process, I want to find out if there are errors in S/W so that people don't experience any inconvenience, and at the same time, I have a dream that the image of NHN Entertainment Service is also positively reconsidered. When I join NHN Entertainment Service, as a computer major, I will study about S/W testing and obtain a certificate. At the same time, I will learn practical skills for verification testing. In particular, the current S/W changes rapidly as new technologies are introduced over time, so I will observe trends in S/W as soon as I have a chance. In addition, I will create a method for explaining the logical explanation necessary for the intervention among in-house employees. In addition, I will contribute to the development of NHN Entertainment Service by building theories and practices through in-house training."
"Since childhood, my parents, who are ""supposed OOO,"" have always emphasized the importance of relationships with people. While attending my parents' alumni, fishing, foot volleyball, and other various gatherings, I naturally got along with strangers and learned how to treat adults and the importance of relationships with people. Through this growth process, I became acquainted with my team members easily in the team project, and even team members who did not get along well with each other with smooth interpersonal skills tried to harmonize. When I took a computer science major called advanced system programming, I did a project to make anything with a given board. Since we didn't know each other, we had a hard time because we didn't give out opinions and the morale was low. However, teamwork improved through synergy effect by helping team members who have a low participation rate due to positive characteristics such as happy virus to actively present. As a result, we created an unmanned crime prevention system that informs applications when movements occur by using a camera module, which we have not learned unlike other groups, and we were able to achieve good results amid the professor's praise. Having professional knowledge is important in a large software development project, but I believe smooth communication and interpersonal relationships are the most important things to accomplish. Like pets that have natural affinity and adaptability to become lifelong companions, I will also be the ""favorite"" OOO who grows up with Invenia with my adaptability and affinity. I have experience in hotel housekeeping in Australia with ""built-in responsibility."" When I first started working as a Korean among my Indian colleagues, I had difficulty adjusting schedules or pushing things forward. I did not mind and focused on doing my job. In particular, I took the room where the blacklist guests were staying without a complaint and tried to fulfill their requirements. This resulted in me leaving work later than other colleagues, but it was rewarding to receive not only tips but also letters from some of the guests thanking them. Also, I was able to open my heart to my Indian colleagues by being willing to take on challenging tasks, and was recognized by my boss, and close enough to being invited to a hotel party. Through this experience, I learned that if you do not do your best in your given roles, you can influence others, and that fulfilling your responsibilities is a process of gaining trust from your members. Therefore, I am proud to have a sense of ownership to do the best you can in a given task and situation and have a strong will to solve the situation in the event of a problem. As an S/W engineer, I think unexpected situations will occur frequently. I will become an engineer who can communicate with members with a great sense of responsibility and respond and solve in the best way in any unexpected situation. ""Mission impossible? No, Mission is possible!"" After hearing the professor's remark that the ARM CPU-based operating system debugging tool is stagnant, I have experience of creating a process visualizer that visualizes the data structure of the ARM CPU-based operating system as a graduation work with my colleagues in the academic study related to embedded work and winning the prize in an on-campus competition. By installing ARM-based Petalinux in the virtual machine and dumping and analyzing the physical image, the program aimed to visualize the processes currently running in the virtual machine and information about each process through Python. Many things necessary to create the program, such as Python, Stream Editor, and Qemulator, were unfamiliar, so I gathered with my colleagues twice a week for a year to present about my field of study, shared the necessary knowledge, and took a step forward by having meetings with the professor every week. Finally, we developed a program to visualize more process information than we had planned. While working on this graduation work, I was able to study in-depth information on the structure of the OS and various information on the overall flow process, and based on this work, I participated in a graduation work contest and received an excellence award. ""Similar to the passion of black people"" I have experience working as the head of the planning department of the school's black music club OOO for a year. During our activities, we had to pay for regular performances, which was higher than before. Therefore, we shared the issue with the club members and developed a ""Pork Belly Skewer"" item to be sold during the university festival through meetings. With a clear sense of goal, I and the club members were passionate in sales and promotion, and the reaction was also explosive, so I was able to make a whopping 2 million won in net profit during the festival. It was an experience to enhance the organization's capabilities by sharing my driving force as the head of the club planning department with my members. In addition, while preparing for regular performances on campus, I produced promotional posters that catch people's attention. Compared to what I prepared, there was a regret whenever a small number of audiences came, so this time, I identified the time zone and area where the students on campus moved a lot, and calculated the working hours of the cleaners who removed the posters, and strategically attached the posters. These strategic promotional activities attracted more than 300 audiences for the first time for the club performance, and the record is still unbroken. If I join Slovenia, I will work hard with this passion to become an R&D institute with outstanding expertise and to become the No. 1 company in the world. My motivation for applying to Slovenia is because I think it is a place where I can share my values of 'challenge' and 'sustainable development'. In order to challenge and continue to develop, we wanted to apply to companies with excellent technology, growth through constant research and development, and colleagues who can learn and go out together. Invenia was the first to localize core equipment for all-display processes in Korea, won the $70 million export tower, and was recognized for its industry's best technology, as well as strengthening its systematic capabilities through the credit system and providing various contents by class, and I applied because I thought that it must be a company that can share my values.""A versatile SW expert in Slovenia"" Taking advantage of the strength of the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I took all major courses such as semiconductor, circuit design, communication, and programming when I was in second grade, and I thought about my career path by learning HW-related knowledge as well as SW. I became interested in S/W field and took related lectures in earnest from third grade. I took C, C++, and JAVA, studied in depth the operating system by taking System Programming and OS as well as Windows Programming, and developed an unmanned crime prevention system program in Embedded Programming and Microprocessor subjects. I have acquired advanced major knowledge for Linux and Embedded S/W research by developing an unmanned crime prevention system program using an arc board. I studied hard every time and was able to receive scholarships for three consecutive semesters with excellent grades in my major courses. I am sure that my versatile experience will be a great help in fulfilling my SW job in Slovenia. After joining the company, I will continue to challenge the SW field with my colleagues like the 'passion of my school days', so that I can become Invenia with the best technology among the manufacturers of display core process equipment."
"While attending university, I have development experience using various languages such as C language, C++, and Python through non-academic projects. First, I have experience in SW development using Python. The scenario of the project is a program that helps to analyze through a visualized program by searching for files equipped with malicious code in embedded equipment. I was interested in the Linux kernel, so I planned the above project during a study meeting. As for the operation process of the program, the Xilinx board is used as guest OS in the QEMU virtual machine, and the target board is restored and analyzed so that the guest OS can be analyzed in the form of a GUI so that the analysis can be made easier by visualizing it in the form of a GUI. Through this graduation work, I was able to study in more depth the structure of Arm-based OS and various information on the overall flow and process, and I had the experience of winning the second prize in the competition by overcoming and completing the lack of knowledge outside my major. Second, I have experience in an unmanned crime prevention system using an arc board. The project scenario is a program that uses a camera sensor attached to the board to capture and output a motion warning message to the user on the Android device as soon as the motion is captured. I called the board company directly, got the manual on the acro board camera, analyzed it, and wrote the code that would cause an interrupt when a motion occurred. I used Python, Stream editor, and acro board in this project, and many other things were unfamiliar to me and new to me. However, after studying for a project for a short period of time, I had the valuable experience of making a planned program, and I had the confidence that if I worked hard, I could do it. Through this confidence and development experience, I will become a developer who can provide excellent service with advanced technology and become an S/W expert who creates new value for my customers. ""Nice to say OOO."" My parents are yard-footed. They have always emphasized the importance of relationships with people since childhood. While attending my parents' alumni and various gatherings such as fishing and foot volleyball, I naturally learned the importance of relationships with people, such as how to get along with strangers and how to treat adults. Through this growth process, I became close to everyone in the team project and tried to harmonize even those who were on the outside with smooth interpersonal skills. When I took a major course in computer engineering called advanced system programming, I did a project to make anything with a given board. At that time, I had a hard time because I didn't know each other well and I had low morale among my team members. However, as a result of actively announcing and accepting the group members who had a low participation rate due to positive characteristics such as the happy virus, teamwork improved due to synergy effect. Therefore, I created an unmanned security system that informs applications when movement occurs by using a camera module, which I have not learned unlike other groups, and I was able to achieve good results amid the professor's praise. Also, I tend to adapt quickly with strong adaptability anywhere. I have the experience of going to Australia for a working holiday. It was my first time in an English-speaking country, so I was frustrated and scared to get a job, but I copied my resume and went around 30 places a day to appeal to myself. After running for about a week, I got calls from various places, and I prepared hard for the interview so I could get a job as a hotel housekeeper. In today's big software development project, having professional knowledge is important, but I think smooth communication and interpersonal relationships are the most important to carry out tasks. Like pets that have natural affinity and adaptability to become lifelong partners, I will be the ""pets"" OOO who grow up with DreamTech with my adaptability and affinity. ""Inbuilt responsibility"" My personality trait is that I am responsible for everything I take on. I have experience in hotel housekeeping in Australia. When I first started working as a Korean among my Indian colleagues, I had difficulty adjusting schedules or pushing them to work. I didn't mind and focused on doing my job. In particular, I took the room where the blacklisted guests stayed without showing any reluctance and tried to comply with their requirements. Although I left work later than other colleagues, it was rewarding to receive thank you letters as well as tips from some guests. I was also able to open up my Indian colleagues by being willing to take on difficult tasks, and I was able to be recognized by my boss and close enough to be invited to a hotel party. Through this experience, I learned that if each person does not do their best in their given roles, they can affect others, and that fulfilling their responsibilities is a process of gaining trust from members. Therefore, I am confident that I have a sense of responsibility to do my best in a given task and situation and a strong will to resolve a situation in the event of a problem. On the other hand, there are some cases where it is difficult to make a firm decision because decisions are prudent in order to solve the situation best every time. In order to correct these shortcomings, I had time to talk with members when I had problems in group life. As a result, I learned that I was close to a rational solution, which allowed me to make a rational decision through conversations at black music clubs and study groups that I belonged to. My prudence became proficient in communicating as well as solving problems through conversation, naturally forming various human networks. As a SW developer, I think unexpected situations will occur frequently. I will be a developer who can respond and solve in the best way in any unexpected situation by demonstrating my communication skills with members with a great sense of responsibility.""DreamTech's versatile SW expert"" Taking advantage of the strength of the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I took all major courses such as semiconductor, circuit design, communication, and programming in the second year, and thought about my career path by learning HW-related knowledge as well as SW. I became interested in S/W and took related lectures in earnest from the third year. I took C, C++, and JAVA, studied in depth the operating system by taking System Programming and OS as well as Windows Programming, and developed an unmanned crime prevention system program in the Embedded Programming and Microprocessor subjects, and acquired the advanced major knowledge for Linux and Embedded S/W research. I studied with my best every time and was able to receive scholarships for three consecutive semesters with excellent grades in my major courses. I am sure that my versatile experience will be a great help to perform my duties as DreamTech's SW development. After joining the company, I will constantly strive to become a Dream Tech with the best technology by constantly challenging the SW field with my colleagues just like the passion of my school days. ""If you want the present to be different from the past, study the past,"" Spinoza said. This is my most important value. In order to live a forward life, I have not only absorbed new knowledge but also made up for what I felt was lacking, and instead turned it into a strength. In particular, in order to become a good programmer, I have developed my skills in other fields. Among them, I have tried to develop my English skills necessary to become a global talent. After joining the military, I started to make short-term and long-term plans to go on a working holiday. During the rest of my military life, I studied English and conversation in the Philippines to prepare basic skills, spent three months in practical training, and 11 months in Australia to raise money, while also studying English and taking a vacation for about a month before returning home. Immediately after being discharged from the military, I left for the Philippines, and in the first month, I actually used what I learned that day and gave feedback. In the second month, I learned words that I usually use in business, and in the third month, I focused on pronunciation correction. After leaving for Australia, I was recognized for my conversational skills among the best among international students and was able to get a job as a hotel housekeeper in just seven days. Also, although the average international student receives an hourly wage of 10, I was able to work for a minimum of 16 dollars and a minimum of 32 dollars. Even after returning to Korea in February 2013, I constantly participated in English conversation studies, provided detailed explanations when I had a situation to speak, such as asking for directions from foreigners, and I was always able to get feedback such as ""You speak English, very well."" It may not be a great feedback, but I am not only proud that it is a result that I gained from my hard work in my 20s, but I am always making progress to become a global talent by working on everything, recalling this experience. Even after joining the company, I will become a SW developer who constantly develops by studying not only new knowledge but also what I lack."
"My motivation for applying to EZCareTech is that I think it is a place where I can share my values of 'challenge' and 'sustainable development'. In order to challenge and make sustainable development, I wanted to apply to companies with excellent technology, growing through constant research and development, and having colleagues who can learn and go out together. EZCareTech developed the hospital information system as the nation's top medical IT company as the first outside of the U.S. to receive HIMSS Stage7 certification and be recognized for its world-class technology, as well as to operate a career development system according to job areas and levels to ensure that it is constantly developing by operating a career development system according to the job area and level, and I applied because I thought that these parts must be a company that can share my values.

""If you want the present to be different from the past, study the past,"" Spinoza said. This is my most important value. In order to live a moving life, I have always not only absorbed new knowledge but also supplemented what I felt was lacking, and made it a strength. In particular, I have developed my competence in other fields in order to become a good programmer as well as a good programmer. Among them, I have tried to develop my English skills, which are essential to become a global talent. After joining the military, I started to make short- and long-term plans to go on a working holiday. During the rest of my military life, I studied English and conversation to lay down basic skills, spent three months in the Philippines for practical training, and worked in Australia for 11 months to raise money, while studying English and taking a vacation for about a month before returning home. Immediately after I left the military, I left for the Philippines and in the first month, I actually used what I studied that day with my Filipino friends and gave feedback.

It may not be a great feedback, but I am not only proud that it is a result of my hard work in my 20s, but I am also constantly making progress to become a global talent by working on everything, recalling this experience. Even after joining the company, I will become an S/W engineer who constantly improves by studying not only new knowledge but also shortcomings.After joining the ""Global Medical Information System SW Specialist,"" I will build trust in the organization by learning the basic postures and tasks that I must have as a member of EasyCare Tech for one year. I will also focus on becoming one with my team members based on that trust. In addition, I will quickly acquire the skills and knowledge related to WPF and .NET development necessary to complete my duties and acquire the necessary job competency related to research within one year. As an employee with a beginner's mind, I will be an expert who penetrates all the business fields of EasyCare Tech by the time of my third year through constant self-development. I will always try to establish a more complete medical environment by analyzing customer needs and discussing with my colleagues. And in 10 years, I will become an indispensable PM in EasyCare Tech and become a senior developer who is recognized for handling projects quickly and accurately by being in charge of the management of projects in the business department. In addition, I will learn English related to constant English study and business in line with EasyCare Tech's expansion into global companies, such as exporting HIS overseas to large hospitals for the first time in Korea. In the global market, I will further increase the competitiveness of the company by directly communicating information that is difficult to understand in parts other than developers. I think my development is the development of EG Care Tech. I will become an employee who does not settle for the present and constantly strives. ""Similar to the passion of black people"" I have experience working as the planning department head of the OOOO school for a year. During the activities, I had to pay an increased cost for regular performances. Therefore, we shared the issue with the club members and developed a 'pork belly skewer' item that will be sold during the university festival through meetings. With a clear sense of goal, I and the club members were passionate in sales and promotion, and the reaction was also explosive, so we were able to earn a whopping 2 million won in net profit during the festival period. It was an experience to enhance the organization's ability by sharing my driving force as the head of the club's planning department with members. In addition, while preparing for regular performances on campus, I produced promotional posters that catch people's attention. Compared to what we prepared, there was a regret whenever a small number of audiences came, so this time, we identified the time and area where students moved on campus, and calculated the working hours of the cleaners who removed the posters, and strategically attached the posters. These strategic promotional activities attracted more than 300 audiences for the first time in the club performance, and the record is still unbroken. If I join EasyCare Tech, I will work together to become an R&D institute with outstanding expertise and become the No. 1 global company by working with such enthusiasm. While attending university, I have development experience using various languages such as C language, C++, Python, and Perl through non-academic projects. First, I have experience in SW development using Linux. The project scenario is a program that helps to analyze through a visualized program when searching for files loaded with malicious code in embedded equipment. Since I was interested in the Linux kernel, the above project was planned during a study meeting. As for the operation process of the program, the Xilinx board is used as guest OS in the QEMU virtual machine, and the target board is restored and analyzed to enable post-analysis of guest OS in Linux and Windows environments, so that the analysis can be made easier by visualizing and analyzing it in the form of a GUI using Python. By overcoming and completing the lack of knowledge outside my major, I gained the experience of winning the Excellence Award in a competition. Second, I have experience in unmanned crime prevention systems using acro boards. The project scenario is a program that uses a camera sensor attached to the board to capture and immediately outputs a motion warning message to the user on the Android device. I called the board company directly, received the manual related to the acro board camera, analyzed it, and wrote the code that generates an interrupt when a motion occurs. Python, Stream Editor, and acro boards used in the above project were the first things I saw. However, by studying for a short period of time for a project, I gained valuable experience in creating a planned program, and through this experience, I gained the confidence that I can do anything with effort. Through this confidence and development experience, I will become a software expert who generates profits from EasyCaretech by becoming a developer who can provide excellent services in more environments in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution with advanced technology"
"""Expanding Mobile Payment Platform"" I applied because I wanted to expand GS SHOP's mobile payment platform field further. Specifically, I would like to create the simplest payment process by applying biometric authentication technology and a chatbot system with high response rates to mobile payments. As the home shopping industry has to actively cope with customer satisfaction and changes in trends, related technology development is constantly needed. The recently released 'Right away Payment ARS Service' stands out in that it has further increased the competitiveness of the industry by improving the purchasing process more simply and quickly. This was because the company was able to confirm that it was constantly striving for customer satisfaction and was active in introducing new technologies, so GS SHOP thought it was the best company to demonstrate its capabilities. ""Realistic interest and effort in new technologies."" I have also been paying attention and efforts to new technologies such as big data and artificial intelligence to expand mobile payment platforms. First, with my experience related to big data, I developed an 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System' linked to the manufacturing industry as a graduation project and built AWS servers and influxDB to manage a large amount of data. In addition, I was able to get a certificate by studying Google Analytics, Google's data analysis tool, recently. Second, I have taken an artificial intelligence course, added depth of knowledge, participated in many IT conferences at World IT Show and Softwave Competition, and encountered various new technologies including artificial intelligence. As GS SHOP has set specific goals based on my experience and knowledge, I will become a talented person who performs with all my passion. ""Active attitude and passion that bring about change."" The internship experience to change the existing one more efficiently is an example of the achievement of passion and persistence. Earlier this year, OO conducted the study and design of the precise map data compression algorithm based on C++. The fact that the conventional compression algorithm showed a low compression rate of about 58% at the time, I wanted to design a more efficient algorithm with the question of 'Why?' So first, I wanted to increase the compression rate through the idea of merging the existing compression algorithm with the Dijkstra algorithm, which I personally implemented in the project 'In-school Shortest Path Guidance System' conducted in the software engineering class. Secondly, I asked my supervisor for his understanding, and I wanted to talk about the progress of algorithm implementation every other day and get some feedback. As a result of constantly trying to complete the idea, I was able to design a new algorithm that increased the compression rate to 71%. The 13% increase in compression rate was not a noticeable achievement. However, the evaluation of seniors in the department that they actively came up with ideas and that the attempt was good was the most satisfactory one. In addition, the experience has made me deeply feel that one of the factors that can change the existing one is the active attitude and passion. When I work at GS SHOP, if I can improve the existing one to lead to customer satisfaction, I will do my best to solve even the smallest part. ""Do an IT infrastructure construction project in Indonesia?"" The experience of an IT infrastructure construction project in Indonesia was an experience that allowed me to look back on myself with enthusiasm. Three years ago, I was dispatched to Rampung, Indonesia as a member of OOO Promotion Agency to gain experience in IT projects. My three developer team members and I were assigned to a local university lab for two months, of which I was in charge of DB construction and web development. The project was to build a new 'e-class system' to replace the old version of the class management system, which was completed for four weeks and applied to the demonstration class. However, in the first week of construction, the new system account creation rate was around 20%, which was a very low problem. At that time, I was in charge of DB and web pages that were directly exposed to users, so I felt a greater responsibility and asked myself the question of 'Why?' the most among my various project experiences. To get the answer, I showed my passion to create and distribute a questionnaire equivalent to 120 pages. The main reason was the functional problem in which the submission was shared entirely by everyone and the reluctance to the English screen. After that, our team worked together to solve the functional problem and worked on page translation with two local students. As a result, we were able to increase the account creation rate to 84% when we were two days away from our team's return to Korea. Looking back on our experience, I realized the importance of management as thorough needs analysis and process feedback are essential. My experiences and feelings will be of great help in the development and operation of systems that I will be passionate about in the future. ""Business Understanding, Constant Development"" I want to be the best developer in the home shopping industry who has built the most convenient apps and payment processes. Due to the nature of the home shopping industry, I think that the simplification of using apps and the simplification of the purchase process is directly proportional to sales. In the current situation where biometric authentication technology is developed and simple payment technology is more active, two specific goals have been established to grow together with GS SHOP with the goal of increasing net profit by 15% within five years. First, I will precede the understanding and learning of the home shopping industry. The business of home shopping is a structure in which various systems such as order, payment, and delivery are intricately intertwined. Therefore, we will not only improve or expand the mobile payment system, but we will certainly understand the business concept of home shopping and proceed with the improvement and introduction of new technologies accordingly. Second, based on our understanding of the home shopping business, we will become a developer who constantly learns and develops to improve various processes and introduce new technologies. As the industry is sensitive to trends, it is necessary to understand IT trends quickly and accurately. We will actively review and benchmark the IT strategies of global home shopping companies to establish specific goals for overall optimization and improvement of the GS SHOP system.Summarizing a 15% increase in net profit within five years and two specific aspirations, we aim to establish an optimized home shopping system through a comprehensive understanding of the home shopping industry business, constant learning and external benchmarking. After joining the company, I will become a talented person who constantly develops and demonstrates passion to achieve the specific goals I set."
"""Essential Competencies of S/W Engineers, Convergent Thinking"" The job of S/W engineers is most suitable for me, who has developed 'convergent thinking' by putting IT convergence into practice as a real project. The job of S/W engineers, who need to quickly and accurately grasp the needs of customers in various fields, is to constantly consider what value the convergence of specific industries and IT creates. We have developed convergent thinking by integrating IT into manufacturing and distribution industries, which we judged to have the greatest value of convergence. First, I have experience in developing 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System' linked to the manufacturing industry with OOO through industry-academia cooperation. I was interested in the smart factory, so I wrote a plan and proposed it to the company manager first, and I felt the value of understanding and convergence of IoT and smart factories first. Second, I developed an 'IoT-based traffic assistance device' by incorporating IT technology into the traditional market. I wanted to understand the requirements of merchants in traditional markets far from IT through the opportunity for the free subject project. I analyzed the traffic problem, which is the biggest problem, and planned it with my team members and made products. Upon winning the Presidential Award in the on-campus competition, I learned that IT convergence based on deep consideration is of great value in itself. The task I will be in charge of provides system integration services in various industries. I will also continue to develop convergent thinking that continuously considers applicable technologies. ""Main Language JAVA and Customer-Centered Attitude"" Until now, we have been steadily striving to acquire expertise in the JAVA field. The SW engineering department is an optimal job to demonstrate my capabilities as system planning and development are carried out based on Java. In order to create practical results based on JAVA, I personally learned the Android language to develop my expertise. In particular, my experience of actively using Open API is my differentiated development capability. What I felt from using Open API several times is that it is also an important quality of developers to properly utilize high-quality information according to the situation. Recently, as I felt the importance of the algorithm, I have added my expertise by taking the national education program to train algorithm-based JAVA developers until August. I carried out a project to link 'Inventory Management System' with Oracle DB using MVC pattern in JDBC. After joining the company, I want to steadily learn customer-centered attitude and create a trusted Dongbu Corporation. When I was a bachelor's degree, I had the experience of collecting requirements directly from faculty and staff in a project that assumed my alma mater as a client. From this experience, I learned that it is important not only to complete the system construction but also to meet the detailed requirements. New technologies are constantly emerging and customer needs are diversifying. I will always be a part of the company that considers whether there are any better technical elements to build the optimal business environment from the customer's point of view. ""Improving the efficiency of compression algorithms"" I have overcome the most difficult crisis with my strength and enthusiasm during my internship. Earlier this year, OOO researched and designed precision map data compression algorithms. At that time, I was given the task of improving the 'compression rate' of map data compression algorithms which have a compression rate of about 58%. Although I established a voluntary goal of raising it to 70%, I had no knowledge of basic GIS (Geographic Information System) and there was a limitation that I had to solve it by myself. However, in order to achieve my goal, I took advantage of my strengths in applying my past experiences well when solving problems. As I recall my experience in implementing the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path I have conducted in the past, I made it my first plan to merge it into the existing compression algorithm. The second question was, I freely asked my junior to do so. I asked my supervisor for his understanding and took a lunch break every other day to receive feedback on the implementation of the algorithm and the contents of GIS learning. After five weeks of constant effort, I was able to design a merged compression algorithm that increased the compression rate by 8%. The increase in the compression rate of 8% was not enough to achieve the voluntary goal. However, the evaluation of seniors in the department that they actively came up with ideas and liked the attempt itself was the most satisfying feedback I have ever heard. No matter what difficulties I encounter even in Dongbu, I will actively solve them based on my strengths and enthusiasm."
"Among the numerous companies, CJ Olive Networks' vision is the most consistent with the research experiences I have had. It was attractive to think about creating value in our lives and to expand new areas by fusion of technology, and I applied because I was confident that I could grow with the company. It's interesting to find and learn what you don't know. I constantly attend ICT seminars, IT forums, and developer education, and I am seeing, hearing, and experiencing new technologies. If it is difficult to attend, my biggest strength is that I always understand the flow of future technologies by experiencing them indirectly through IT news articles such as blotter and zdnet. Currently, I am conducting technology-based human-centered research at the graduate school, and I have infinite affection and pride in my research lab. Students majoring in humanities, design, and engineering formed a multidisciplinary team to collaborate together in every process from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted research on HCI, UX, and IoT for two years. Due to the occupancy time of cafe customers, research was conducted in various fields to create unprecedented value, such as subway passenger distribution systems, display smart curating services, and improvement of waiting times for children's hospitals. When working on a project to reduce the experience waiting time at a children's hospital, even though I was an engineer, I also participated in the work of discovering problems by observing it for three days at the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities and design majors, I was able to cultivate collaboration skills. In this way, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that future problems can be solved together even if the experiences that I have solved head-to-head come into the company. When visiting the OOO Museum's permanent exhibition, I have experience launching a smart curating service using the Bluetooth function and beacon of a smartphone. As an industry-academia joint project, I formed a team with one company and majors in planning, design, and participated, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team to experience the design process and learn design sensibilities. I was responsible for researching indoor location-based algorithms. Initially, Bluetooth signals were used to implement them, but the accuracy of wireless signals was low indoors for actual commercialization services. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and successfully applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike projects that were simply developed as demonstrations at schools. The final test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can lead to customer loss. This is the most meaningful example of convergence technology research because I could experience the process of the creation of new services indirectly by companies such as CJ Olive Networks, and I could also sympathize with the fact that numerous people's efforts follow behind it. I am confident that my experience in designing every process from problem recognition to solutions can help me create values even as a member of CJ. It will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes based on user experience based on the research capabilities developed through collaboration. Based on the collaboration skills and convergence capabilities acquired through two years of efforts, I want to create new customer value that combines technology and business with CJ Olive Networks. Core technology is included in all products and services, but the ultimate target of technology is people. It will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop human contexts from the research and development stage. Based on the engineering capabilities of electronics and communications learned in the Department of Information and Communication Electronics, I believe that it will be a great advantage for me to join CJ Olive Networks and conduct convergence technology research. The field I want to study after joining CJ Olive Networks is deep learning. Recently, I am studying deep learning at the same time, and I am also studying various classification algorithms through statistics and data mining classes that support this. In addition, beacon data is collected and analyzed in the project ""Development of Technology to Improve Robustness and Precision in Indoor Location Estimation Technology"". In the ""Development and Validation of Interactive Language Learning Device"" project, we are testing object recognition application demos that have learned 1000 objects and are looking for ways to increase the recognition rate. I hope to grow into the next generation of key technology experts and global leaders in CJ Group. I want to focus on research and development of future technologies of artificial intelligence based on the research capabilities I have been carrying out. Furthermore, I want to create new future industries such as smart factories, smart logistics, omnichannel, and other new customer values by converging core technologies with customer businesses. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book a month and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. The field of artificial intelligence, along with CJ Group, is the most active area for research and development in major global companies, and as new knowledge and related technologies are pouring out every day, I will become a researcher at the Convergence Technology Research Institute and try to become a talented person who will challenge by repeating the process of discovering, implementing, testing, and applying new technologies to catch up with and overcome trends."
"""The convergence and collaboration skills that I have learned over the past two years"" Two strengths that I can confidently say are superior to other applicants are convergence and collaboration skills. Core technology is included in all products and services, but the ultimate target of technology is people. It will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop human contexts from the R&D stage. Based on the engineering competencies in electronics and communications that I learned in the Department of Information, Communication, and Electronics Engineering, I conducted convergence research for two years with my friends who majored in humanities and design in graduate school. Once, a museum conducted a project to apply for a curating service on exhibits. The core technology was to accurately position the BLE signal indoors. We collected and analyzed the wireless signals several times, but due to the nature of the BLE signal, there has been little success for a long time due to its low power and stability. The reason for accurate positioning was to provide accurate services to viewers of the exhibits, but when we looked at the fundamental problems, we found out the direction and behavior of the person, which could be solved. In the end, we were able to solve the problem by fusion of the BLE wireless signal, a relatively accurate acceleration sensor, and a direction sensor. Through this, we published a paper in the International Conference on Convergence Technology 2017 as a result of drastically reducing the false detection rate of BLE signals, and even applied for a patent. When I was working on a project to reduce the waiting time for people to feel, I was also an engineer, but I observed it for three days at the hospital and participated in discovering problems. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and I was able to cultivate my collaboration skills by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities majors. As such, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that the experiences that I solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together at LG Electronics. I have always done research in the fields of HCI and IoT, as my dream of working in the R&D field of ""First Mover of Convergence Technology"" and creating new things is in my heart. Just as I was always proud when I went home after studying until late at night, I think the joy will double or triple if LG Electronics focuses on the latest technologies and develops them in the future. The HCI field is considered an essential discipline in the 4th Industrial Revolution, but in the case of Korea, it is recognized as a very unfamiliar field as an early stage. It will be the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out social and human communication skills according to the demand of the times that changes from technology to user experience-oriented. In addition, as the one-person maker era has arrived, I want to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes and conduct constant research. In order to achieve the above goal, the goal is to read more than one trend book per month and publish more than two papers or patents per year."
"""Programming and Practice A"" means a lot to me as this is my first major basic course. The C programming language has been used in various fields from general application programming to network, system, and graphic programming because it includes both high-level and low-level languages. Therefore, it is the most basic language, but it is also an essential language that I have learned the longest. Therefore, language C is one of the languages that I am most confident in. It is a valuable subject that I have learned some basic skills as a student majoring in ""Creative Engineering Design A+"" engineering. In this course, I first defined the problem when a certain problem was given, and then I learned the overall contents of the problem-solving process that create an idea, evaluate it, judge it, and put it into action. This course also helped me a lot in developing the necessary skills to become an engineer, which I cannot experience alone. ""Object-oriented Programming Basic A+"" The JAVA language is one of the most widely used languages now, as it has both the advantages of C language and the characteristics of object orientation, which are easy to understand by both humans and machines. This course helped me a lot in developing JAVA language-based Android applications. It is a smart band and concentration game that was created during the ""BeSmart Game"" wearable software competition. We have developed a concentration game that allows for a slight improvement in children with attention deficit disorder by linking a headband and an application that can measure brain waves with an application. I was in charge of developing Android games, but since it was my first project in my life, I had a lot of difficulties developing the Bluetooth reception part. I searched and read books in the library and implemented them by referring to them on the Internet, but it remains the most impressive project as it was my first experience. ""Piano Staircrafting (Android)"" One day was the way to class at school. The stairs were empty, but when I saw a lot of students flocking to the elevator, I thought, ""How can I distribute the students to the stairs?"" and thought, ""It would be nice if I could play the piano sound every time I climbed the stairs."" So, I conducted a team project in a class called Comprehensive Design with the motifs of three things: interest-inducing, exercise, and energy-saving. We detected people's feet through sensors and printed out the right sound for each step as a sound, and produced an Android application that can be operated on a smartphone through Bluetooth communication. Lastly, I remember that it was installed on campus for three days and received a lot of attention from students and professors. I felt a special sense of accomplishment in that I solved the problems of our living spaces. Since you have to work ""loving"" for a long time, you can get tired easily if you don't do it with interest and pride in what you want to do. However, when I imagine my friends playing a game that I developed with my own hands at NHN Entertainment, I think I can work with pride and joy. ""Engineers need to know how to express themselves."" There is one thing I recently felt. I think SW engineers should be able to write what they think and express themselves in words. I will work on that in the future because I think that no matter how good an engineer is, if he or she lacks these skills, he or she cannot become a good engineer. Korea's mobile game market, which is ""convergence,"" has grown rapidly, centering on Kakao games. New mobile games are pouring out every month, but most mobile game forms looked similar. If NHN Entertainment provides a differentiated service than other game companies, I think it can lead the mobile game market further in the future. If wearable devices such as Google Glass and smart watches, which are growing along with mobile games, are combined into games, it will be a differentiated weapon from other companies. NHN Entertainment wants to create a tangible game by utilizing the sensors installed in the smartphone or by linking other hardware."
"I think Dongbu has a more important responsibility than other companies because it provides solutions to financial IT companies where security is the most important. As such, Dongbu applied because I thought that only more important and valuable people could work. With the introduction of virtualization and cloud, I think the need to analyze how much traffic applications generate has become important. Since efficient network operation leads to cost savings and profit improvement, we thought it was necessary to identify and prevent network vulnerabilities that can cause failures, analyze the flow, and appropriately apply QoS according to the purpose to optimize network resource use. When I implemented DNS server using Java language while taking the information and communication system design course, I understood the operating principle of DNS through the team project and was able to check the type of packets using the Wireshark program. During vacation, I also obtained OCP certification by taking the OOOOODB curriculum at Oracle DB and Big Data Expert Course and OOOOO. Once, while I was an intern at an ERP solution developer for a month, I was able to feel the working atmosphere while testing the groupware developed by OOO company domino notes. Recently, I installed the kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi in my lab and controlled GPIO. Finally, I linked the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and stored it in the database and checked it on the web. With my experience in programming or internship at an ERP solution development company, I want to grow into a great ICT engineer who develops systems in the east. Challenges to learning are always interesting. During vacation, I was able to experience the design process and empathize with the design sensibility while taking a UX design school course. It may be ironic that engineering majors study design, but in the 4th Industrial Revolution, I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to create a good solution without going through the UX design process that recognizes humanities value judgment and sensitivity rather than technology. I have the ability to develop core technologies based on engineering I learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics, and the ability to develop efficient applications through convergence research in the HCI and UX fields in graduate schools. Due to the occupancy time of cafe customers, research in various fields was conducted to create unprecedented value, such as subway passenger distribution systems, display smart curating services, and improvement of waiting times for children's hospitals. Even though I was an engineer, I participated in the task of discovering problems by observing them for three days in the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process. I have always tried to be the best in the field of ICT convergence, so I have been able to achieve good results so far. I will become a talented person who constantly challenges and contributes to the organization even as an Easterner in the future. I have experience in launching a smart curating service using Bluetooth and beacon in the OOO Museum. Although we were in charge of researching indoor location-based algorithms and initially implemented them using BLE signals, we found a problem with low accuracy due to signal distortion and refraction caused by high ceilings and steel walls. It was a big crisis prior to commercialization, but we constantly visited the site every day to observe facilities and people for better performance and looked for ways. After much consideration, we overcame the crisis by significantly lowering the error rate by implementing an algorithm that fused relatively accurate magnetic field sensors. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. I learned that commercialization services are very difficult, unlike simple school projects. The test process also took a considerable amount of time because errors can even lead to customer loss. Through this, I was able to experience the process of the creation of a new service in a company such as Dongbu Group, and I could also sympathize with the fact that there are numerous efforts behind it. In addition, I was able to communicate with the multidisciplinary team and experience the design process, and based on the convergence and collaboration capabilities that designed the entire process from problem recognition to solution, I would like to create new customer value that combines technology and business with colleagues."
"If you look at the intelligent building system of Lotte World 2 or the U-City in Wonju, you can see scenes that you have only seen in science fiction movies applied to your life one by one. I want to join Lotte information and communication, which is moving forward for a ubiquitous world, in making imaginary characters a reality. When I was carrying out a national project at the Korea Institute of Production and Technology, I had a meeting with doctors for two months to develop ways to collaborate in the organization and teamwork skills. I also experienced difficulties indirectly by watching the collaboration process with partner companies in detail through the engineering doctor next to me. I think that the experience of large-scale projects and collaboration between companies can effectively apply the business requirements of Lotte ICT's business to the industry and contribute to the creation of a profit model. ""Fancy going out, I see as much as I know."" After seeing the wide world in the deep sea at 18m, Vauxhall Island, the Philippines, I felt as much as I wanted to. I had a severe phobia about water since I was young, but I tried scuba diving because I didn't want to live avoiding it all my life. I saw thousands of kinds of fish in the sea, and I experienced the beauty of the beautiful deep sea by taking pictures with sea turtles. In the meantime, the sea was a dangerous place for me, but now it has become the most beautiful place. As the saying goes, ""As much as I know and as much as I feel,"" I felt once again that experience becomes an asset and I can see the world in a richer way. The rough journey with my friends was cheated by their poor English skills and at night there was a dangerous situation where they were questioned by the police for unreasonable taxi fares. However, through this journey, I developed a broader perspective and helped me a lot in improving my confidence. ""Parking 6,000 cars in just two months?"" I liked cars since I was young, so I got my driver's license as soon as I turned 19. When I was a freshman in college, I wanted to try different kinds of cars, so I worked part-time at a department store valet parking. The OOO VIP parking team managed an average of 1,800 vehicles a day by just 10 parking staff, and I was running around alone parking more than 100 cars. At first, I was embarrassed because the side brakes and gear transmissions were different for each type and manufacturer, but I had a valuable experience driving from imported vehicles to domestic vehicles to small vehicles to large vehicles. I want to become a new employee of Lotte Information and Communication because I like IT, just like I worked part-time at valet parking because I liked a car. As much as I try my best to be passionate and immersed in what I like and want, Lotte Information and Communication will contribute to generating profits in new businesses through my passion and immersion in IT. On the way to the ""Building a System in the School"" class, I saw many students standing in line in the elevator, and I looked for ways to increase the utilization rate of stairs. I thought that if I could play the piano sound when climbing the stairs, it would increase the use of stairs and reduce the congestion of elevators. I gathered a team at the OOO Society and carried out a project to solve the problem. It detected people's feet through sensors and output a scale suitable for each step through a speaker. Troubleshooting occurred due to electricity during the output process, but the cause was found through a systematic approach and analysis and solved through ground readjustment. Through Bluetooth communication, the company even improved the quality of its projects by providing an application that allows students to operate on their phones. This project helped improve their technical capabilities, and the project was able to be installed at the school for three days to attract the attention of students and professors. Above all, it remains an unforgettable memory that we solved the inconveniences in our lives through this project. ""Presentation Skill"" engineers need to be able to write technology and express it in words. However, most engineers have excellent personal skills, but they lack a lot of presentation skills. This is also my biggest weakness. Assuming that I have a competency of 10, I often get underestimated because I can only say seven. To compensate for this, I am constantly making efforts to improve my team projects, such as giving presentations as representatives. ""Executive leader! Humble junior!"" I will always be active in all projects with the spirit of master that I value. And I believe in the power of the word ""we."" I will be a strong stepping stone between seniors and juniors to create smooth teamwork and synergy by emphasizing ""we"" rather than ""me"" in a team project. For one year after joining the company, I will actively utilize the mentor-mentee system and in-house programs to quickly adapt to the atmosphere of the company. In five years, I will work hard on the business of expanding several overseas businesses on behalf of Lotte Information and Communication in Asia. I will study not only English but also the local language from time to time. In 10 years, along with the many innovative projects I have made, I will be a leader who leads the team by example and a junior who is always humble and willing to learn from the seniors. I will always challenge with passion and become an active and fluid employee who changes rapidly in a rapidly changing era."
"LG CNS's business is the most consistent with the research I have done. It was attractive to think about providing value and to expand into new areas by fusion of technology, and I applied because I was confident that we could grow together. Currently, I am conducting technology-based human-centered research in graduate school. Humanities, design, and engineering majors formed a multidisciplinary team to collaborate on everything from problem recognition to solutions, and conducted research on the fields of HCI, UX, IoT, and AI for two years. When working on a project to reduce waiting times at OOO Hospital, I also experienced the process of discovering problems by observing them for three days at the hospital. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in desk research and by experiencing the entire process from the planning stage to the solution stage, I was able to have a wide range of insights. In this way, I am confident that the experiences that the team solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together with LG CNS. Language C is the longest learned language because it is used in various fields from application programming to network, system, and graphic programming. At the university level, I am good enough to implement a demo program, and I can say that it is the most confident language. Recently, I installed the kernel on the Linux operating system using Raspberry Pi and controlled GPIO. Finally, I was able to link the temperature and humidity sensor with MySQL and store it in the database and even check it on the web. In addition, I tried to create artificial intelligence Amazon Alexa with Raspberry Pi, microphone, and speaker using open source, and while studying deep learning, I have experience implementing cost function and gradient design function in python language. In January of this year, we launched a smart curating IoT service using beacon in the OOO Museum. As an industry-academia joint project, I participated in a team with one company and planning, design, and majors, and I was able to communicate in a multidisciplinary team, experience the design process, and learn design sensibilities. The main role was the study of indoor location-based algorithms. At first, it was implemented using only BLE beacon, but the accuracy of the wireless signal was low for actual commercialization service. As a result of the test, the service we wanted was not properly performed, and other methods were needed for better performance. After much consideration, we implemented the algorithm by fusing relatively accurate magnetic field sensors, and we were able to solve some of the problems in terms of accuracy. Through this, we published a number of papers and applied for two patents. Unlike the project that was simply developed as a demo at school, it was difficult to commercialize it, so we were able to indirectly experience the process and difficulties that companies such as LG CNS had in developing new services, and I could also sympathize with the fact that numerous people's efforts follow behind it. I want to become a person who creates unprecedented values in smart factories, logistics, and new future industries by focusing on future technology R&D and converging technology with customer business. Core technology is included in products and services, but in the end, people are the ultimate target of technology, so it will be more meaningful and necessary research if you understand and develop the context from the research stage. Based on the engineering capabilities of electronics and communications that I learned at the undergraduate school, I think that the two years of convergence research at the graduate school will be a great strength in in in-depth research and development in the future. In order to become an engineer who understands the trend of the times and actively responds to changes, I read more than one trend book a month and set a quantitative goal of publishing more than two papers or patents a year. As new knowledge and related technologies pour out every day in the IoT and artificial intelligence fields, I want to become a talented person who challenges the discovery, implementation, test, and application of new technologies to keep up with the trend."
"""I will become a network quality management expert."" In the second semester of my second year, I came into direct contact with the field of communication while taking a signal and systems course. The grades, which were not good compared to the interest I felt, made me focus more on the field of communication. I will join KT and become a talented person who grows together with KT. I will work at the front line of network service and become a person who absorbs many things like a sponge. After that, I will try to optimize the quality of the network so that customers can use the best communication services by spewing out a lot of things that I have absorbed. Wherever KT's influence is reached, we will provide communication services that can further highlight the know-how in network management that has been accumulated as much as KT's long history. I will vividly convey the convenience I felt to customers. I will be an engineer who considers customer satisfaction so that customers can always use the best quality and service without any inconvenience. ""Teamwork that begins with consideration and communication."" Last semester, we conducted a long-term group thesis assignment that takes up a large portion of our grades. In the process, I experienced various problems such as irritation, stress, and discord among the group members. There were two major problems in our group. First, the lack of active participation by a small number of members clouded the overall atmosphere, and the hard-participating members became dissatisfied and an opinion was formed to penalize those who did not attend. Second, this atmosphere was formed, so the disagreement between the members of the group deepened while insisting only on each other's arguments without concessions during the exchange of opinions. In this regard, I asked the low-participating members of the group about the reasons for not being able to participate, and suggested that if there was a reason, I give them another role to deal with the situation. The team members with justifiable reasons were given other additional roles, such as summarizing and organizing the assignment, determining the meeting place, etc., so that they could participate in the assignment and understand the progress. As a result, everyone was able to keep pace together. In addition, on days when we had time to spare, we had a conversation while eating together after the group meeting, and exchanged opinions in each other's minds with time to promote friendship. In this way, through conversation and communication with all the members of the group, I was able to finish the thesis in a good mood while receiving good grades. Through this experience, I realized the importance of teamwork among members, and that for teamwork, we must work together through proper communication and conversation. ""I will become a communicative talent."" After being discharged from the military, I worked in a distribution center. At that time, my role was to organize the inventory within the company. While I was working, I was moved to another department by the manager. The department was in charge of rearranging the new items so that the staff ladies could work quickly. There, I came to work in pairs with an employee with a disability. The working ladies said they were having difficulty with their work because of the employee with the disability. Working together, I found that they were having difficulty organizing the items in alphabetical order. I thought about how to handle things efficiently. It wasn't difficult for the general public, but I judged that the employee with the disability received a large amount of goods instantly and was confused. So, I received the items first and assigned them to the employee who was not feeling well. So he was able to handle small tasks one by one, working without getting them wrong. In addition, both I and several employees in the company are now able to handle tasks efficiently. There, I learned how to act as a bridgehead by grasping each other's positions and situations when problems arise, and how to handle tasks efficiently for everyone. Based on this experience, I will efficiently handle tasks through communication within the company. In addition, I will play a role in providing the best service by thinking from the perspective of the customer in the network control/operation job. ""We will provide the best service for everyone."" In the era of Giga Internet, our lives seek fast speed and good quality. While living in a world where days are passing by faster, areas and people who cannot keep up with the speed are emerging. As I have questions about these differences in communication, I think we should be able to communicate with the same speed and quality as in the city center as well as in the outer areas. Based on this experience, I will make sure that the network system can perform as well as in the outer areas as in the central areas. Also, in the event of a failure, we will try to solve the problem quickly and accurately. And as a major, I will thoroughly manage the software part of the system so that there is no problem."
"""The importance of a trust network I felt firsthand"" I wanted to create a trust network with each other. With the knowledge I gained while majoring in computer engineering, I was able to find ways to be helpful to someone and build a trust network. When I was a bachelor's degree, the first thing I wanted to do when I was in the second year was to apply as a mentor for a mentoring program within the department. The reason is that I wanted to help a junior like myself because I had experienced difficulties in setting up a career path when I was in the first year. Working as a mentor for a basic programming subject, I met a total of six juniors once a week. I wanted to convey my major knowledge effectively, so I encouraged voluntary participation by preparing examples appropriate to the level of my mentee juniors, going beyond formal ones. In addition to learning guidance, I saved each and built trust with each other, such as advice as seniors and counseling on school life. As a result, I became interested in conveying to someone in my own way as I saw the juniors who were mentees actively participating with trust in me. In addition, to this day, I was able to feel the importance and reward of creating a new network while maintaining junior relationships and opening up my thoughts with each other's trust. ""The essence of the lecture is the elderly."" Another opportunity to form a trust network was the education service using smartphones for the elderly. As a volunteer member of a telecommunications company, OOOO Welfare Center conducted three hours of training every Friday for four months. I was actively engaged in the program's purpose to reduce the information gap between generations and my goal of learning eye-level communication. As for the training method, eight team members organized the training contents for a week together and held many-to-one lectures on Fridays. However, a fatal problem occurred during the course of this lecture method, and I actively suggested to the team leader that the lecture method be changed to a multi-group lecture. There was a problem that at least one to as many as three people kept skipping classes every week. The main reason was that the content of the lecture was too difficult and one-sided, so it was difficult to follow. Therefore, my suggestion was that one team member would give lectures to three to four senior citizens to increase the efficiency of the lecture. There were already some team members who were burdened with giving up on high-quality manuals and traditional methods. However, the elderly actively persuaded us that they trusted us and wanted to learn one thing, and as a result, the group lecture began in the fourth week. The team members felt a sense of responsibility, and the elderly only focused on what was needed, and the quality of the lecture naturally improved. In addition, I felt sorry for the seniors who were absent, so I called them one by one again to talk about the new teaching method, and finally, I was able to achieve a valuable relationship by conducting the lecture with a total of 27 minutes for about three months. One of the seniors I worked for still sends me a text with questions from time to time. Whenever I receive a text message, I feel proud that they still trust me and that an important trust network has been formed. It made me realize that mutual trust networks are important once again beyond formal networks based on each other's needs. Not only through two experiences, but also through multiple situations, I felt the importance of a trust network in which I trust the other person and the other person trusts me. Midas IT also wants to build a trust network in the second act of life through communication without walls up, down, left and right. ""Trust 30, responsibility 30, technical understanding 30, and I will fill the remaining 10 points."" The most important practical competencies in the web solution technology support job are trust, responsibility, and technical understanding. Through specific questions at the job information session held at my alma mater, I learned that the job that best suits my aptitude and competency is web solution technology support. ""Trust 30: I will make trust in products and companies from myself."" What I wanted to achieve the most in my life was to form a trust network. Above all, if the other person trusts me, the core of network formation was to repay the trust that I also responded to. In addition to a department mentoring program and a smartphone-based education for the elderly, I also had experience in IT education services in Indonesia three years ago. As a member of OOOOOOOO, I taught programming language C and video editing programs in Lampung, Indonesia to local university students. Most of the local students had difficulties, but with trust in my lectures, they asked me questions about things they didn't know even after class and participated in the last class. In order to repay the trust along with the class, I thought of making lecture materials so that my team can review them even after returning home. The textbook that I started producing in the third week has been over 80 pages since the end of the lecture, and I was able to get feedback from local students thanking them for making a textbook that I can review. In order to build trust in Midas IT and its products, I think we need to build the customer's trust in me first. I am ready to draw the customer's trust by having a sincere attitude toward the other person and forming a network that does not want compensation. ""Responsibility 30: I learned from the conviction of being with the customer until the end without falling behind."" While drawing out the customer's trust, the appropriate responsibility is also an essential competency of the technical support job. I have developed a sense of responsibility through the conviction that all of my team members should be together in team projects. Two years ago, I had the experience of making some sacrifices to help my team members while working on a development project. Among the four randomly assigned teams was a Chinese friend who was an exchange student. In the process of sharing roles, the friend was embarrassed by the lack of knowledge of Java that will be used in the project. The team members implicitly suggested that only participation be significant, but as the team leader, I objected. We came together to gain practical project experience, and we wanted to feel a sense of accomplishment by actively participating.As a result, I took the time to teach my Chinese friend Java using my past C language mentoring experiences when we gathered twice a week for the development process. Although my development part was a little slower, my Chinese friend followed me well, making the project progress much easier, and I was able to hear my Chinese friend's proud feedback saying thank you for learning a lot. Recently, the needs of customers are becoming more diverse and subdivided. Customers who trusted Midas IT's products thought about the future, constantly compared and reviewed other products, and finally purchased them. Therefore, I thought it was essential to have a responsibility to support each customer's detailed needs in a cooperative manner, provide appropriate user training if necessary, and stay with them until the end. ""Technical Understanding 30: I will cope with it with sponge-like absorption."" Finally, I thought that appropriate technical support and user training were possible only when a complete technical understanding of the product and solution was based. A complete understanding requires absorption that can be sucked in like a sponge without fear of new things. As a graduation project, it was necessary to learn about Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which are ultra-small PCs, while developing the 'IoT-based Facility Failure Prediction System'. In addition, for communication with the server, I had to learn a new language, Python, not the Java language I was previously confident in. As it was a year-long graduation project, it was a very busy time with various procedures such as analyzing requirements, designing, and testing in addition to development, but I tried to find a breakthrough effectively. Two team members, including me, were in a similar situation, so I suggested a study in which we presented and discussed what we had been studying twice a week during the vacation. With the consent of the team members, we were able to continue the study for about 3 months, add teamwork, and consequently advance the development time more than planned. This is a valuable experience that we have come up with effective methods to understand new contents and have produced results through teamwork. There should be no resistance to new technologies as various solutions and products come out and require a lot of technical support. I am also interested in IT trends and various new technologies, so I always look for them and organize my thoughts by scraping the parts that I think are important. After joining the company, I will be the first to completely understand Midas IT's various products and solutions. ""The remaining 10: I will always find and fill in the shortcomings."" Although I have consistently had the ability to trust, responsibility, and understand the product line, I think the remaining 10 points are scores that I can fill by experiencing actual practice after joining the company. When solving a problem, 'using past experiences well' is my strength. In my internship life, I studied data compression algorithms using algorithms I learned in past projects, and tried to solve conflicts arising from team projects in various ways. I will perform technical support work based on my strengths at Midas IT, and I will have an active attitude to utilize the competencies I have gained in the past. In addition, I will flexibly cope with various situations arising from the relationship between the customer and the team members based on trust and effective coping methods in the past."
"By collaborating on the ""Donghwa Group's co-worker"" and ""Improving the in-school course registration system"" project, we obtained the results of the 7th place in the interim evaluation and the 2nd place in the final evaluation. Through this, I learned the power of collaboration and grew into a person who practices collaboration. The final goal of the project was to express the functions delivered by the improved system in UML such as use cases, ERD, DFD, and sequence diagrams. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded on the way due to early employment. As I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course, gave questions and answers at times through messenger, and helped my team members understand. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, my team members' skills have improved significantly enough to write DFD on my own. My task alone was very overwhelming and I felt a lot of time pressure. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the position of the team members by recalling the old me, who was difficult, and I tried my best to reflect on the fact that it was a common goal, not just a single goal. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without a single person falling behind, resulting in high-quality results. Collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but I think it also means that if there are colleagues who are struggling, they are willing to self-proclaim and share and lead the difficulties. If I had not led a team member who was lagging behind, not only would the final result of the project have not been produced within the period, but I think the meaning of the team project would have also changed. I will become a co-worker of the Donghwa Group, which creates team results by demonstrating my main weapon, collaboration ability, which is my main weapon in the IT industry, where collaboration is dominated. ""The concept of thorough time."" My new life is 'Let's keep time promises'. Reflecting on my mother's advice to not even be friends with people who don't keep time promises, I also tried to become a thorough person in time promises, and I am still trying. For example, while working part-time at an academy for a year, I prepared classes by arriving 20 minutes in advance each time. I was the first teacher who has worked so far who has never been late, and I received a proposal from the director. This thorough concept of time has made me reborn as a sincere person. I will be a sincere new employee who is not always late even after joining the fairy tale group and does my part. ""What's the good thing that makes you smile so much?"" My personality strength is bright energy. In preparation for the contest, I raised the spirits of my team members with my bright energy. When I first prepared for the contest, it took a long time due to the topic selection. In the end, I had to stay up all night every other day from the point a week before the submission period. I prepared a surprise snack for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and I ate snacks and talked with them, using my rechargeable energy to finish the contest safely within the period. At that time, the team members nicknamed me 'OOO', saying, ""What good thing happened that made you smile so much that you meet?"" Even if I become a member of the fairy tale group, I will always be a room that never loses my laughter in any bad work. The disadvantage of my personality is that I have a strong desire to win. I often get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my desired goal. After finishing second out of the six teams unfortunately in the sports competition I participated in when I was a freshman, I had an experience that hindered my studies as I couldn't get my hands on things all day long. To overcome my shortcomings, I am trying to look at the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon even if I experience successive failures. I will be reborn as a challenging person who does not fear failure by fusion of restrained desire for victory and positive thinking. I will be a person in the Donghwa Group who challenges with the confidence that I can do it. 1) Why you want to do an application job, 2) why you have to be this company, 3) How the accumulated competencies can be used in the application work can be used in the process ""Building Happiness with Donghwa Group"" I realize that IT is indispensable in the industry as IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, is actively taking place. I majored in industrial engineering and was fascinated by IT that supports the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a convenient world with IT with Donghwa Group. Donghwa Group, which is expanding into the world by carrying out businesses closely related to life such as materials, auto life, and media, has the most suitable environment to realize my vision to contribute to the happiness of everyone, young and old. I believe that I will be able to enjoy my work as if I were playing in a Donghwa Group, which seeks happiness based on the EVP, an employee value proposition. Together with these Donghwa groups, I will create a convenient world with IT. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as suitable talents for the Donghwa Group's IT job. ""First, competencies required to perform tasks."" In addition to development skills, IT managers must also have an understanding of the industry. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to sharply grasp the characteristics of the industry by working on various projects that combine IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design using Cloud Computing"" and ""Improving Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores."" I decided that the foundation of IT is data, and I majored in multiple statistics to learn in-depth about data processing and analysis. In the process of learning statistical programming such as SAS or R, I developed numerical analysis skills. After completing the undergraduate program, I took an application SW engineer training course at the OOOO Institute and learned several IT knowledge, including Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, JavaScript, Oracle, Spring Framework, and MyBatis.By using the learned knowledge, I have acquired practical skills by conducting development projects such as Free Video Lecture Sites and Used Auction Sites. ""Second, Competencies Required for Work Life."" After working as an intern at OOO for 6 months, I learned the basics of work life that are trivial but should never be overlooked. For example, when I was handed a task, I realized that it was more important to immediately ask and get the instructions correctly and give the right result rather than reversing the task by trying to solve the problem by myself. I will use all these capabilities to develop happiness with Donghwa Group. There are two things I want to do in Donghwa Group. ""First, Developing an Intuitive System for the Middle and Elderly."" Looking at my parents who are not familiar with using mobile apps and homepages, I thought that I would like to develop a more intuitive and convenient system for the elderly. I would like to develop and operate a button location on OOO Auction, where used car auctions are held online, and on OOO, an online portal that provides used car market prices, with the user's convenience. ""Second, Development of Real-Time Inventory Management System"" Inventory management will be of paramount importance in the materials business, which is one of the main businesses of Donghwa Group. By developing a system that instantly updates fluctuating inventory information, I want to deliver convenience to employees of Donghwa Group and improve its management efficiency. In doing so, it is my ultimate goal to deliver convenience and pleasure to everyone who is with Donghwa Group. I will make an attractive and interesting Donghwa Group that I want to visit often from the standpoint of customers who are ""leading the used car market."" I will contribute to building an integrated platform environment to convey the feeling of using a used car store anytime, anywhere by applying the omnichannel service. In this way, I will lead the used car market with Donghwa Group. In order to achieve my goal, I will take the next steps. After joining the company, I will focus on learning the work process by going to work 30 minutes early every day. After five years of joining the company, I will constantly learn new IT technologies so as not to be eliminated from the rapidly changing IT environment. In addition, I will continue to study foreign languages to increase my competitiveness in the global era. I will be a 'Donghwa-in' who constantly looks at Donghwa Group from the customer's point of view and strives to minimize the inconvenience customers feel. Ten years after joining the company, I will become a global IT expert who can be the cornerstone of Donghwa Group's growth as a leader in the global wood industry and a leading brand in the automobile distribution industry of Korea. ""Working well, and Who I want to work with"" I took an application software engineer and DB engineer training course at the OOOO Institute of Education, and for about five weeks, I worked on the ""Development of Used Auction Sites"" project for nearly 10 hours a day with the goal of ""absorbing 100% of what I have learned through the project."" The goal of the project was to develop a used auction site where safe transactions are guaranteed by supplementing the limitations of used sites where there is anxiety among buyers caused by unsafe transactions. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, login, information modification, and withdrawal. While implementing the membership registration function, I wanted to add a profile picture registration and preview function for transparent transactions, which is the main focus of used auction sites, and to challenge functions I have not encountered. To this end, I studied data processing in the form of Multipart through efforts such as Googling and asking for advice from the instructor. Due to complex source codes and errors occurring everywhere, morale has also been lowered. However, looking back on my goal, I immediately asked questions that I did not know enough to jokingly hear 'pay for extra tutoring to the teacher', and I tried to make the acquired one's own. Even after class, I conducted separate personal learning through a book called Toby's Spring and learned in an active attitude. As a result, compared to the previous 'I', the breadth of knowledge has improved significantly, and I have confidence that I can do anything. In addition, I was honored to win first place among eight teams in the project presentation. In this way, I have a spirit of challenge to learn new knowledge and develop existing knowledge. Now, I will show you all of these in the fairy tale group. I will always learn from you in a humble manner and show you how hard I work on my own. In this way, I will become a new employee of Donghwa Group who is good at work and wants to work with you."
"""Exercise commitment to a common goal"" A dedicated person in my opinion is a person who does his or her best to achieve a common goal even at the expense of his or her own loss or sacrifice. For example, I have grown into a person who practices dedication by carrying out a project to improve the course application system. Due to early employment, a team member who was in charge of PM was excluded, so the project had to be carried out with a small number of 3 people. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was a little behind in a situation where a small number of people had to share a large amount of work. As the team member delayed the schedule little by little, complaints poured out from all over the place. As a student majoring in industrial engineering, I decided that I lacked basic knowledge of diagrams and helped my team members understand by taking the time to explain the basic concepts such as objects and attributes step by step. At first, it was a bit difficult to understand an unfamiliar concept, but it quickly followed and finally reached the level of writing DFD on its own. I felt a lot of pressure to take charge of multiple tasks at the same time, but every time I did, I tried my best to remind myself that it was not my own goal, but a common goal. As a result, we were able to complete the project safely within a given period by actively participating without a single dropout. I will be the top contributor to Hanwha S&C, which is devoted to the team, no matter what difficulties we face in the IT industry, which is mainly collaborating. I challenged various IT experiences in order to be reborn as a talented person suitable for Hanwha S&C's application operation job. First, while working as an intern at a research company, I was in charge of managing the survey DB. Through JDBC, we implemented the function to inquire, add, modify, and delete the survey DB collected by linking Java and Oracle. In the process of understanding the data flow inside the server, we increased our understanding of the system. Second, while taking an application SW engineer training course at the OOOO Training Institute, we carried out a project to build a server similar to the corporate web using HTML5, CSS, JS/servelet, and jQuery. Focusing on maximizing user convenience and ease of maintenance, we proceeded with the project and developed practical skills. In addition, while dealing with Java, we gained knowledge necessary for application operation jobs such as algorithms and data structure. Third, during my undergraduate years, I engaged in various projects that combined IT and industry, such as ""Smart Factory Design Using Cloud Computing"" and ""Clothing Store Inventory Management System Design,"" and developed communication skills as well as the ability to clearly grasp the characteristics of the industry that customers are engaged in. I can't say that my job competency is superior to anyone yet. However, I am ready to grow with Hanwha S&C based on the IT experience I have challenged so far. ""I have too much desire to win."" When implementing a goal, I tend to be unable to look around with motivation, and when I fail to fulfill my desired goal, I get too much stress. I don't think I've overcome it easily because I'm the second of three sisters and was formed as a result of competition in good faith. In order to overcome my shortcomings, I'm trying to see the situation with positive thinking and confidence that another good thing will come soon, even if I taste a series of failures. I will be reborn as a challenging person who does not fear failure by fusion of restrained competitive spirit and positive thinking. I will become a talented person of Hanwha S&C who challenges with the confidence that I can do it. ""Speed fast."" I tend to speak faster when I am nervous or excited. I often hear a joke that you rap because you speak fast. I tried to speak slowly, but I couldn't overcome the desire to deliver the story quickly. Recently, I received a feedback that if I slow down my speech a little while conducting a job study, I will be able to impress interviewers better. Before I say anything, I am trying to organize it in my head again and then talk calmly. I will be the medium of communication between Hanwha S&C, which communicates with accurate pronunciation and calm accent. ""Central Inventory Management System"" In the rapidly changing IT environment, if there is no SMART insight and differentiated CREATIVE that looks into the far future, you will fall behind. In order to deliver a true impression to customers by competing with various existing IT services, I think SMART&CREATIVE must be added to the service. In the project under the theme of ""Designing the Clothing Store Inventory Management System"", we proposed the introduction of a central inventory management system to achieve maximum customer satisfaction. We found the inconvenience of the existing system that could not check the inventory of offline stores online. If we receive inventory information in real time, the customer's convenience will be greatly improved, but we decided that it is not difficult for companies because it is difficult to link order information DB and inventory DB in real time. In order to improve the efficiency of both customers and companies, we proposed the introduction of a central inventory management system that immediately processes order information DB and inventory DB. There were numerous trials and errors before we came up with the introduction of a central inventory management system. However, I don't think the process was a waste of time. I was able to find myself more SMART by devising a CREATIVE plan for system users. Even after joining Hanwha S&C, I will become the leading person who practices SMART&CREATIVE, Hanwha S&C's vision slogan, SMART&CREATIVE. ""Leader of the Fourth Industrial Revolution"" Amid the rise of the 4th Industrial Revolution, where intelligence is achieved by IT, Hanwha S&C is rapidly absorbing IoT technology that leads the 4th Industrial Revolution, such as sensing and service interfaces. This is a great advantage of Hanwha S&C, and it is expected to grow into a leader in the fourth industrial revolution soon by creating insights and synergies of Hanwha S&C, which provides timely IT services according to the trend of the times.The media industry is a field that can be easily accessed by anyone of all ages and can communicate directly with customers. It is true that Hanwha S&C is not recognized significantly because it does not hold the lead in this field. However, we are focusing on discovering new businesses such as global fintech and data business, so we will be able to overcome our shortcomings easily. ""Securing Competitiveness in Major Businesses"" In order for Hanwha S&C to grow into a Global ICT Leader in the future, securing competitiveness in Hanwha S&C's main business should be given priority. In the case of the smart factory, which is Hanwha S&C's main business, it is the most active field right now by acquiring SIT's factory automation technology in 2016, but there are not many places where the smart factory process has yet entered. If we supplement this and apply the new business model to various industries, we are confident that it will not be long before it grows into a Global ICT Leader."
"""Skin Food Supporters Increase Event Participants by 200%"" Working as a Skin Food Supporter, I challenged to increase the number of participants in a new product promotion event by 200% and have achieved this. The new product promotion event was the activity that reflected the team score the most, so I set a goal of increasing the number of participants by 200%. The team members, like me, were greedy to win first place, so I had no doubt that they would achieve their goal if everyone worked together. Skin Food Supporters have been holding events at universities where they have been invited. However, most universities that tried to recruit refused because the scheduled event date and the exam period of college students overlapped. I was at a loss because the event date could not be changed, but I didn't give up and came up with a new way to reflect on my goals. After the meeting, I decided to hold the event in a downtown area rather than in a university. There were many things to prepare for due to a sudden change of venue, so I focused on planning by increasing the weekly meeting to two or three times. As a result of sharing roles such as recruiting places, designing, and purchasing goods, the event held in Myeong-dong under the concept of ""Hammer Game with Thor"" in parody of the then-popular movie Avengers ended with a response of more than 250 people. Due to the challenge toward the goal, persistence that did not give up, and collaboration with the team members, we were able to easily overcome unexpected difficulties and achieve an increase of 200%. Even after joining the company, I will become an SK C&C person who creates team results by demonstrating challenges, persistence, and collaboration acquired through this experience. In a project under the theme of ""Creative Central Inventory Management System"" and ""Improvement of Clothing Store Inventory Management System"", we proposed a ""Central Inventory Management System"" that benchmarked the McDelivery service with a unique idea and improved the problems of the existing system. When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. I felt the need for a system that could check the changing inventory situation in real time from the customer's point of view. As a solution to this, we proposed a 'central inventory management system' that benchmarks the McDelivery service, which is a method of delivering order information received centrally by store. To differentiate it from the McDelivery service, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location based on GPS location-based services. As a result, it was well received by the professor in charge as a system that satisfies the needs of customers and efficiency of corporate operation, and it ranked first in the creativity and convenience category among the eight teams. There were numerous trials and errors in applying the McDelivery service to the inventory management system because the service items were different. However, we worked hard to design a differentiated system by meticulously writing UMLs such as physical and logical designs, service blueprints, and use cases. Various IT technologies and products have already appeared, so unless they are creative, they will not be able to easily capture the hearts of customers. For this reason, I think creativity is an essential element for developing technologies that keep up with the rapidly changing IT era. We are ready to support SK C&C with IT services based on creative thinking. ② The ERP mechanism, which I learned by majoring in industrial engineering, can be applied to the development and operation of smart factory systems, and I applied for the IT knowledge acquired in the 'Application SW Engineer Training' to the judgment that it will be best used in the development and operation of web and mobile-based platforms. I will personally prove that SK C&C has no regrets about choosing me because I have the core competencies required to carry out application development tasks, such as understanding and development capabilities of the industry, and sensible work skills. 1. Understanding the Industry: To clearly reflect the customer's requirements in the application, you need to have an understanding of the industry that the customer is engaged in. When I was an undergraduate, I worked on a number of projects that combined IT and industry, such as 'How to build a smart factory using cloud computing' and 'Improving the inventory management system of clothing stores', and developed the ability to grasp the customer's industry sharply. 2. Development Competency: It is the development competency of the IT manager that enables efficient support through the application. I learned IT knowledge such as Java, JSP, JQuery, Oracle, MyBatis, and Spring Framework in the 'Application SW Engineer Training' and based on this, I developed my development capabilities by conducting 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site' development projects. In addition, I acquired a SQLD certificate to develop an application that considers not only the accuracy of data but also the usability, and developed my SQL writing ability. 3. Sensible Work: After working as an intern at OOO for 6 months, I acquired sensuous work skills. For example, when I received a task, rather than trying to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage, I immediately learned exactly what I was asked and instructed, and produced a quick and correct result. As a result, I was praised as a skimpy intern by the assistant manager. ""SK C&C's co-worker's in improving the in-school enrollment system"" project, and through collaboration, I achieved results ranging from 7th place in interim evaluation to 2nd place in final evaluation. Through this experience, I felt the power of cooperation to make what seems impossible possible. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind when the team member who was in charge of PM for early employment was neglected along the way. He was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML because he was a double major student. Since a small number of people had to share a large amount of work, I decided that I would not be able to produce results within the period if I overlooked the team member, so I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member.At first, it was a little difficult to learn unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of consistently helping me learn, I made the DFD I set as a goal. It was such a burden of time that I had to stay up all night every other day from a week before the final evaluation. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, encouraged the team members, and I tried my best to remind them that it was a common goal, not just my own. As a result, I was able to attract everyone's participation without falling behind. I learned from this experience that collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but also that if there are colleagues who are in trouble, they are willing to self-proclaim and share and lead difficulties together. I will become a co-worker of SK C&C that creates team results by demonstrating my main weapon of collaboration, which is my cooperation in the IT industry."
"""The fundamentals of all medicines are people, and the fundamentals of pharmaceuticals are IT."" I will work with Ildong Pharmaceutical, a top-notch company that contributes to human health and a happy life. I believe IT is the source of Ildong Pharmaceutical, which was launched in 1941 under the motto of 'The fundamentals of all medicines are people.' I believe that Ildong Pharmaceutical has been able to vigorously advance into the new 100 years of its founding history. With the program I developed, I will find it in Ildong Pharmaceutical, a professional reward that promotes the convenience of users and improves the management efficiency of a company. It has the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding a 'reverse branch' mind to the technology gained from various project experiences ""from the perspective of users, not from the perspective of station branch or developers."" In the project titled 'Improvement of the Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores', we found the inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory when using online clothing stores, and proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government collectively by store, as an improvement measure. As a result, there was a lot of admiration among the students about how they could come up with this idea. With the mind of 'reverse branch', we will develop a program that minimizes the inconvenience that users feel and satisfies the needs. ""Collaboration, My Own Growth Key Point"" The biggest achievement so far was the experience of obtaining the second place in the final evaluation in the 'Improvement of the in-school course registration system' project. It is the most accomplished experience in that it has achieved great growth from the 7th place in the interim evaluation to the 2nd place in the final evaluation. The growth key point was collaboration. There was a team member who was in charge of PM for early employment, and to make matters worse, I was left behind in a situation where I was neglected. Since they were multiple majors, they lacked basic knowledge of UML. Judging that the final result would not be produced within the period if the team members were overlooked, I delivered reference materials, helped with Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team members. I felt a lot of time pressure as I had to have repeated overnight meetings from a week before the final evaluation. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of the team members by recalling the old me, which was difficult, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal. As a result, I was able to attract everyone's participation without falling behind. ""Ildong Pharmaceutical's Converged Talent"" They are convergent talents who have both development and communication skills, which are the core competencies required to carry out information strategy tasks. ""What if they develop? By far, it's me!"" In the application SW engineer training training, we developed development capabilities by carrying out development projects such as ""Free Video Lecture Sites"" and ""Secondhand Auction Sites"" based on JSP, Oracle, JQuery, HTML5, and Spring Framework. It has developed technology by implementing mobile phone authentication using Open API and Quartz technology for processing Garbage data. In addition, in order to develop a site that considers not only the accuracy of data but also the usability, we have developed our SQL writing skills by obtaining SQLD certificate. We will demonstrate our development capabilities to help stabilize and hinder the program and improve it to more advanced programs. ""A good listener, good talker"" Through my internship experience in the role of middleman between the team leader and the interviewer, I have grown into a good listener and good talker. Through smooth communication, I will break down the barriers to dialogue due to diversification of knowledge background and terminology inconsistency."
"When I was in high school, I was hacked several times and became interested in security experts, so I went to a related department. The department class was a process of acquiring basic knowledge about security in various fields, and the direct work content was divided into five categories: planning, system operation, inspection, response to infringement, and personal information protection through the subject of security career exploration. I usually have a lot of worries about small things, so I am a person who makes a preliminary plan and proceeds with it, and I applied because I thought that my strong point of being responsible and meticulous in checking the safety of the system fits well. For this job, I have maintained high grades by focusing on department classes to acquire basic computer and security knowledge. I also obtained an information processing industry driver certificate by organizing what I learned, and I am currently preparing an information security industry driver certificate. In addition, in order to experience actual security work, I conducted an internship for two months in the infringement accident analysis team as a field practice. During the internship period, I acquired information related to vulnerabilities by acquiring security trends and writing manuals to be used in the company's products, and based on this, I also simulated buffer overflow in vulnerable applications and wrote an analysis report. Through my short internship, I was able to communicate with various people and experience analysis work indirectly. Since I was very young, I was passive and shy, making it difficult to hang out with my relatives, let alone friends. I spent most of my time with computers because my parents worked together and I didn't have many friends in elementary school. At that time, I was jokingly teased by male students for being a little chubby, and when I was sensitive to the behavior of others, I became more depressed. When I entered middle school, I was unable to make any friends and spent a year in seclusion, and I decided to improve my personality through this. I tried to think positively by making a bright expression in front of a mirror to overcome my self-esteem, and it was difficult to make eye contact when talking to others, but I tried to get used to it. In the new semester, I first approached and talked to a friend sitting alone, and I sympathized with what she liked. Through these efforts, I was able to find out that there are people who like me, and I was able to overcome my avoidance of interpersonal relationships. While living in college, I decided to lose weight for the first time. I started thinking that I would never be able to do it again if I were not this young, and I set my goal not for a short-term reduction but a long-term war, suppressed my appetite for 5 months, and steadily conducted home training without missing a day. During this period, I lived in school and went to an academy to improve my TOEIC scores during vacation. The moment I felt free and gave up even for a day, I was able to achieve my goal by minimizing the promise. It is easy but clear that it is a difficult task to make a plan that I should do every day and try not to give up. After that, I remembered the pride and sense of accomplishment at the time, I planned to acquire a certificate and experience as an intern, and I want to become a self-developing talent in the future. In a class called Big Data Application Security, I worked on a project to model the IP traceback technique. The project was divided into four areas: Python, Hadoop, R, and Arena, and I played a role in analyzing the correlation between the ip header fields using R. The team was formed through random drawing, but compared to other teams, the atmosphere at the beginning of our team was not passionate and individualistic play was strong. During the team meeting, there was no initiative to suggest the direction of progress or report the detailed progress of the role, and no answer was obtained when asked about or opinion on the group chat room. At first, I planned to follow the lead if there was a friend, but I was embarrassed by the passive atmosphere. After I completed my role to induce active participation of the team members, I organized the IP traceback technique, informed the team members, executed the initial Arena sample model formed by another team member to inform them of the wrong point, and advised them to read the materials to be presented by other team members in advance and to correct them. As a result, the team members began to exchange opinions on the final results one by one, and shared roles to share. As a result, I was able to get good grades in the team project and received compliments indirectly from other team members. At first, I was worried that the project result would be a disgrace compared to other groups, so I was worried about my performance, so I was the first to lead the team and play the role of a mood maker in a project I spent time on, and it was an experience where I felt proud through the changing team atmosphere and progress."
"When I was young, I had the experience of not making friends because of my timid personality. In order to improve my personality, I tried to approach people with a smile and love myself more, and I was able to get positive reviews from others. In addition, I have a habit of making plans and achieving them steadily from my experiences such as dieting, obtaining a certificate, and improving my language score after coming to university. A job is to engage in economic activities and realize oneself. If you have a talent for what you like and can get the goods you need to live, you have to choose without hesitation. In order to become a security expert who was interested in high school, I went on to the Department of Security, and as I studied my major, I became more interested in it and chose it. I thought, 'If there is any information you want to keep the most, what is it?' Many people do, but I think it is financial information. After the large-scale security accident in the financial sector that occurred recently, I became more aware of its importance. KB Kookmin Bank applied because it thought it had a strength in the information security sector in that it was the first in the financial sector to hire white hackers. I thought it was important to first build basic knowledge to enter the information security department, so I focused on studying my major during the semester. Based on this, I obtained the information processing technician license, and I am currently preparing for the information security industry technician license. In addition, I spent two months as an intern at a security company to experience work indirectly and gain social experience. Through the internship experience, I was able to understand security trends and have the opportunity to study various vulnerabilities. I had a free Europe trip by myself for about a month. It was not a 100% prepared trip to make travel plans in parallel with my department class. I was worried about acting rudely because I was not familiar with the culture of the country I went to for the first time, and I had many problems in transportation, language, and budget. I was depressed with worry and fear right before departure, but when I arrived, I was amazed and excited with anticipation. Also, seeing relaxed foreigners made me think, 'What should I do to live without such stress?' As a result, I thought, 'I shouldn't worry too much'. Usually, I started to worry about trivial issues or personal history easily, so I was afraid to challenge new things and lived like a frog in a well. I think this experience gave me the courage to fight back without being afraid of the future. Therefore, I would like to recommend to my acquaintances who are usually timid or scared to go on a trip alone. Recently, AI banking has stepped into the financial market. Now, AI distinguishes owners and provides existing mobile banking services through voice recognition. In response to this, I think we need the ability to provide differentiated competitiveness by understanding and applying new technologies emerging from the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the future. New technology fields that emerged from the Fourth Industrial Revolution include big data, AI, and IoT. While taking a Big Data Application Security course, I have experience in big data analysis using Hadoop and R to extract the desired information, and I have devised a technique to track the spoofed ip and produced a simulation. Also, I think we will be able to devise a way to safely introduce new technologies in terms of security compared to others by watching the daily security and security news every day."
"Shinhan Data System is a company that can confidently shout ""YES"" to the question, ""A company that co-exists together with Shinhan Data System?"" Since its establishment in 1991, I have been moved to see SMART including Mobile, information protection, and more recently, Shinhan Data System that expresses the will to co-exist with customers through strengthening ICT R&D capabilities. As Director Lee Dong-joo said at the SDx Technology Research Agreement Ceremony, ""We expect Shinhan Data System to further solidify its position as a leader in the digital age,"" we were able to gauge the future of Shinhan Data System, which will not yield to any future 'customer impressions'. Along with Shinhan Data System, a warm ICT company that shares the future, it will be a strong support for the dreams and future of customers. ""Shinhan Data System that gives happiness and is loved by all men and women of all ages"" We will create a Shinhan Data System that is happy and loved by all customers. Parents who have difficulty in issuing public certificates visit the bank in person or ask me for help despite the fact that there is a simple and fast application when making financial transactions. If IT services including intuitive functions such as voice recognition and bio-authentication are developed, I think we can expect to secure middle-aged and elderly customers who are not familiar with using non-face-to-face channels as well as to enhance the image of Shinhan Data System. In order to implement the envisioned function directly, trust with service users and expertise in IT service development are required. I learned this while in charge of developing online survey UI in Korea Research. I tried to build trust by putting consideration for the user in the size, color, and location of the button by reviving the experience that all the posts that were written by clicking the wrong button were lost. In addition, I gained expertise by learning various IT knowledge such as MyBatis, JQuery, and JSP. I will work with Shinhan Data System to develop the service I envisioned as a reliable and professional employee. ""I am a convergent talent"" I am a convergent talent with information system knowledge and development capabilities, which are the core competencies required to perform financial IT development tasks. When I was an undergraduate, I took computer science courses such as information system analysis design and industrial system programming, and learned methodologies such as object orientation and CBD. We have developed the ability to understand the flow of data by expressing systems that reflect requirements in projects such as 'improving the in-school course registration system' and 'improving the inventory management system of clothing stores' in modeling languages such as use case, ERD, and DFD. We will exert this knowledge to clearly reflect the needs of users in the system. In the training for training applied SW engineers, we developed a 'free video lecture site' and a 'used auction site' project based on the Spring Framework. We developed development capabilities by implementing SMTP-based email authentication and Quartz technology for processing Garbage data. In addition, we acquired SQLD certification and developed our SQL writing ability. We will develop the financial IT of the Shinhan Data System that is easy and easy to expand functions by demonstrating our development capabilities. As an interim project to train SW engineers applying ""Communication, DNA in my blood vessels"", we developed the importance of communication by conducting 'development of free video lecture sites'. Since it was the first project, everyone was already motivated. The team member who was in charge of developing the bulletin board wanted to add a comment function, and I, who was in charge of linking the member DB, wanted to implement a profile picture preview function. However, it was difficult to implement all the desired functions within a short period of a month. As a result, communication was insufficient because each person was only immersed in their duties, and as a result, the DB and class modifications were not properly communicated, errors occurred in the process of integrating the code. To resolve the error, I worked on the project even after class. Although there was only a week until the deadline, I realized the importance of communication, so I immediately delivered, converged, and shortened the time when there was a fix. As a result, the project was completed safely within the period of time, and we were able to demonstrate a site that contained all the functions we wanted. Communication is DNA in the IT industry, where collaboration is dominated, and the deadline, completeness, and the Shinhan Data System's communication medium will capture two rabbits. ""Fruit 'creative' with the root of 'teamwork'."" When I was working as an OOOO supporter, I tried a creative challenge to change the venue of the new product promotion event to a downtown area and achieved a 200% increase in participants based on teamwork. OOOO supporters have been holding new product promotion events at selected universities. The target of the existing event was a university student. Judging that there are many restrictions on holding an event at a university and the main purchasing group is not limited to university students, I suggested moving the venue to a downtown area and expanding our target. This groundbreaking idea was accepted, and we parodied the hit movie Avengers and held an event in Myeong-dong with the concept of 'Hammer Game with Thor'. The event, which was planned with the team members from one to ten, ended with a great response from about 250 people. The foundation of the creative challenge that is not afraid of change is teamwork. Due to the solid roots of 'teamwork', we were able to safely finish the event within a certain period despite a sudden change in venue. With this teamwork and this challenge, we will bear the fruits of countless 'creatives' on the Shinhan Data System. You have the ability to make people's lives more convenient by adding a 'reverse branch' mind to the technology that has been strengthened by the experience of various projects ""from the perspective of users, not from the perspective of station branch or developers."" For example, we found inconvenience from the user's point of view in the 'improvement of the inventory management system for clothing stores', and proposed a central inventory management system as an improvement measure. When using an online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory.I felt the need for a system that can check the changing stock situation in real time from the user's point of view. To this end, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the central government by store. As a result, students were impressed by how they came up with this idea, and they ranked first in the convenience category. Based on the 'reverse branch' mindset of users looking at Shinhan Data system from the perspective of users, not developers, I will accurately understand users' needs and minimize the inconvenience users feel. ""What's the good thing that makes you laugh when you meet?"" It's a word that can describe me, 'bright energy.' In preparation for the contest, I raised the spirits of my team members with bright energy. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of overnight meetings, and I used my energy to recharge by eating them, and safely finished preparing for the contest. At that time, the team members nicknamed them 'OOO' by asking what good things happened to them that made them smile so much when they meet. I will be the 'OOO' of Shinhan Data System, which never loses its smile in any bad work."
"The ability to see the forest and coordinate the whole thing is necessary for a system that maximizes convenience. He majored in industrial engineering and worked on a number of projects to improve the existing system, and in the process of deriving the optimal system, he has grown into a person who looks at the forest and coordinates the whole thing. For example, I was working on a project under the theme of ""Improving the Course Registration System in Schools,"" and I thought about how to maximize the convenience of classmates who use the course registration system. As a result of grasping the functions and data flow delivered by the course registration system and contemplating directly by the user's position, I found the inconvenience of not meeting the needs of students. In response, we proposed an improvement plan that reflected the information on the number of people surveyed through the application for the desired lecture, and received great response from the classmates. The ability to see the forest and coordinate the whole thing and the affection as a customer of Korea Trade Information and Communication will create synergy, making the system development job ""an act of repaying the affection for Korea Trade and Communication"" rather than just a workplace. ""My History Is the History of Korea Trade Information and Communication."" As IT convergence, an convergence between IT and other industries, has been actively conducted, I realize that IT is indispensable for the industry. While majoring in industrial engineering, I was fascinated by IT that supported the smooth operation of the industry, and I applied to create a convenient world with IT along with Korea Trade information and communication. Korea Trade information and communication is achieving 'green growth without paper documents' by pioneering the Korean electronic document industry, such as accredited electronic document centers and e-commerce transactions. Just as the saying goes, 'The history of Korea Trade information and communication is the history of Korea's electronic trade', I want to mark a milestone in the history of electronic trade by creating a convenient world with IT. I have developed two competencies to be reborn as talented people suitable for the Korea Trade information and communication IT jobs. ""First, competencies required to perform tasks."" IT personnel must have an understanding of the industry as well as development skills. During my undergraduate years, I developed the ability to clearly grasp the characteristics of the industry by conducting various projects that combine IT and industry, such as smart factory design using cloud computing and improvement of inventory management systems for clothing stores. In addition, I majored in statistics twice and learned statistical programming such as SAS and R, so I developed my numerical analysis and data analysis skills. Currently, I am taking an applied SW engineer training course at the KH Information Education Center and learning Java, HTML5, JSP, JQuery, SQL, Spring Framework, and MyBatis. Using the learned knowledge, I acquired practical experience by conducting development projects such as 'free video lecture sites' and 'used auction sites'. ""Second, competencies required for company life' Office workers prefer broken new employees the most. Working as an intern at a research company, I developed my ability to handle broken jobs. For example, when I was instructed by the assistant manager to call the survey subjects once more every 30 minutes, I called those who were absent once more at every 30 minutes, and left text messages for those who still did not answer. In addition, I have learned the basics of company life, such as greeting brightly and taking notes on tasks you ordered immediately, which are trivial but should not be overlooked. I will make a bold mark in the history of Korea Trade Information and Communication by using all of these capabilities. There are two things I want to do in the Korea Trade Information Communication (KOTI). First, developing an intuitive system for middle-aged and elderly people. Seeing my parents who are not familiar with using mobile and Internet public certificates, I thought I would like to develop a more intuitive and convenient system for middle-aged and elderly people. I will work hard to develop and operate a button with the user's convenience in every single location. ""Second, developing an independent open source"" In order for KOTI to grow into a global leader, I think it is urgent to develop an independent open source. We will develop our own system that is simple and highly secure to create KOTI that is differentiated and competitive. In this way, what I ultimately want to do is to deliver convenience to everyone who works with KOTI. I will follow the next steps to achieve my goal. I will focus on learning the work process by going to work 30 minutes early every day after joining the company. After five years of joining the company, I will constantly learn new IT technologies so as not to be eliminated from the rapidly changing IT environment. In addition, I will continue to study foreign languages to enhance my competitiveness in the global era. I will always look at Korea Trade Information and Communication from the customer's point of view and constantly strive to minimize the inconvenience that customers feel. Ten years after joining the company, I will become a global IT expert who can be a leader in the e-trade market and a cornerstone for the growth of the future of the global paperless industry. I have been reborn as a person who values collaboration in the process of encouraging team members who have faced difficulties by carrying out the ""Korea Trade Information and Communication Co-worker"" project to improve the inventory management system of clothing stores. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded in the middle of the process due to early employment. Judging that I lacked basic knowledge of diagrams because I was a double major student, I delivered the materials I referred to when I took the programming course and helped my team members understand by giving me questions and answers through messengers in my spare time. At first, it was somewhat difficult to understand unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I improved greatly enough to write DFD on my own. I was very overwhelmed and burdened with time just by my task, but I did my best by reflecting on the fact that it was a common goal, not just my own. As a result, everyone was able to actively participate without falling behind and produce high-quality results.I will be the co-worker of Korea Trade Information Technology (KITA) that demonstrates my core weapon of cooperation in the IT industry. I have the experience of enhancing the efficiency of projects with my bright energy in preparation for the ""OOO of KITA"" contest. Due to the long delay in selecting the topic, I had to stay up all night every other day from the time a week before the submission period. Everyone was tired, but my bright energy encouraged the team members to do it, and I completed the preparation for the contest safely within this period. At that time, the team members gave me the nickname of 'OOO' because what good thing happened that made me smile so much that I could meet them. I will be OOO who smiles brightly in any event."
"""Collaboration, DNA in my blood vessels"" The DNA in my blood vessels is 'collaboration'. While working as an intern, which is my first social experience and external activities with team members with different majors, I felt that 'the power stemming from collaboration is greater than the power of a single person with excellent ability'. Since then, I have been practicing collaboration by using DNA. For example, through collaboration in the 'Improvement of the in-school course registration system' project, I obtained the results of the 7th interim evaluation and 2nd final evaluation. There was a team member who was a PM because of early employment, and to make matters worse, I was left behind when the team member was neglected. I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML because I majored in multiple majors. Judging that I would not be able to produce results within the period if I overlooked the team member, I delivered reference materials, assisted in Q&A, and filled in the shortcomings of the team member. I felt a lot of time pressure as I had to have repeated overnight meetings from a week before the final evaluation, and I was overwhelmed just with my task. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of my team member by recalling the old self-imposed difficulties, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal rather than a goal alone. As a result, we were able to attract everyone's participation without a single dropout. If there is a colleague who is struggling even after joining the emergency education company, I will be willing to self-proclaim and demonstrate collaboration to share and lead the difficulties together to produce results. I set my goal of ""achieving 100 points in bowling"" as ""like working is playing,"" and I achieved it by happily immersing myself in it. It has been more than a year since I started bowling, but I had a poor score of over 50 to 60 points because I lacked athletic ability. As a result of studying the players' attitudes while watching videos and trying to achieve 100 points by being coached by a friend who is good at bowling, I was able to achieve 115 points in just three months. I think I was able to achieve thrilling results because I enjoyed bowling as a means to relieve stress. I am also confident that I will perform my work happily as if I play. Through persistence, I overcame difficulties I encountered through the project ""I am the icon of persistence"" and ""Development of a used auction site."" Since it was my first time folding data processing in the form of Multipleart, errors occurred frequently in the process of implementing the membership function of uploading profile pictures. Frequent errors and complicated source code undermined my morale, but I did not give up, immediately asking questions that I did not know enough to jokingly hear ""pay extra private tuitions to the teacher."" After class, I studied individually through Toby's Spring book and Googling, and as a result, I was second among the six teams. I learned that there is nothing I can't do if I have the perseverance not to give up no matter what the difficulties I face. ""Bright Energy-rich medium of communication."" My strength is ""Bright energy."" In preparation for the contest, I used my bright energy to cheer my team members up. I prepared surprise snacks for my team members who were tired of a series of sleepovers, and even tapped into the role of mood maker by presenting funny images at times. At the time, they gave me the nickname ""OOO,"" saying they had never met a bright friend like you. My complement is ""strong desire to win."" I often get excessive stress when I fail to fulfill my desired goal. After finishing second out of the six teams in the sports competition that I participated in when I was a freshman, I had an experience that hindered my studies because I couldn't get my hands on things all day. I am trying to see the situation with a positive thought that even if I fail to overcome my shortcomings, another good thing will come. I found a compromise through communication in the 'Free Video Lecture Site Development' project. While implementing the quarterly competition functions, there were divided opinions on whether to post individual questions or in groups of 20 questions. Since I couldn't overlook any of the opinions, I compromised by posting 5 questions per difficulty level, considering the project schedule and DB performance, and led the satisfaction of the team members. I will become the 'communication medium' of emergency education that derives the optimal decision-making by collecting everyone's voices through an open return. 'Emergency Education Convergence Talent' They are convergent talents who have the knowledge of information systems, development skills, and communication skills, which are the core competencies required to carry out digital education system planning. 1. When I was an undergraduate of information system knowledge, I learned methodologies such as object-oriented and CBD by working on projects such as 'improving the course application system' and 'improving the inventory management system of clothing stores'. Based on this, I developed my system analysis and design ability by expressing the system that reflects the requirements in modeling languages such as Use case and DFD. I will exert this knowledge to design the digital education system logic logically. 2. Development Competency Application SW Engineer Training conducted 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Second-hand Auction Site' development projects based on the Spring Framework to cultivate development competency. In addition, in order to develop a system that considers not only the accuracy of data but also its usability, I acquired SQLD certificate and developed my SQL writing ability. We will provide various educational services suitable for smart environments by demonstrating our development capabilities. 3. Through various team projects, internship experiences in the role of intermediary between the team leader and the interviewer, I have grown into a person who listens well, talks well, and knows how to solve well. Through smooth communication, I will break down the dialogue barriers caused by diversification of knowledge background and terminology inconsistency. ""Innovative Worker to open the era of digital textbooks along with emergency education"" With the experience of several projects, you can innovate your skills to maximize customer satisfaction. For example, he proposed a central inventory management system by innovating in the ""Improving Inventory Management System for Clothing Stores"" project.When using the online clothing store, there was an inconvenience of having to contact the store directly to check the inventory. As an improvement, we proposed a central inventory management system, which is a method of delivering order information received from the center by store. In order to differentiate it from the existing system, we added a function to recommend stores close to the customer's location through GPS location-based service. As a result, I was deeply impressed by how I could come up with this idea among the students, and I tasted the joy of winning first place in the creativity category, along with the favorable reviews from the professor in charge of the system that is innovative enough to be sold right away. I think innovation must be added to the service in order to truly impress customers by competing with various existing IT services. We will create a better educational environment with digital education services that add innovation and support emergency education that leads the educational culture of Korea. Emergency education will be an Innovative Worker that can serve as the cornerstone for emerging as a leader in smart convergence education that will open the era of digital textbooks."
"""Consideration and communication for consensus."" The commitment I think is to spare no voluntary effort to achieve the goal. In the process of planning the festival as a representative of the grade, I devoted myself to reaching an agreement, believing that consideration and communication were the center of collaboration. Since the festival is one of the university events that college students look forward to the most, I made different resolutions to plan an event that satisfies everyone. In the process of sharing opinions through meetings, it was difficult to coordinate opinions due to differences in positions of each department. It was expected that it would take a lot of time to reach an agreement by raising profitability in the general affairs department, interest in students in the planning department, and external aspects in the chairman and vice-chairman. To solve this problem, I asked for guidelines from each department. Based on the guidelines, I continued to mediate opinions to hold events that satisfies everyone, emphasizing consideration and understanding with each other, and reaching consensus that students could be satisfied within the budget. I think the reason why they disagree within the same organization is that their responsibilities are different. Accordingly, I experienced that it was possible to accurately grasp each responsibility and requirement, consider each other's position, and communicate with each other, and derive satisfactory results. I will become a professional application operator of Hanwha S&C that seeks consensus and facilitates smooth work by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions. I took the major course of ""Team Project that Successfully Completed Despite Limited Time and Few Team Members"" and proceeded with the team project to develop new services and model business. All of the team members participated in the project with enthusiasm, and the theme was to freely share opinions and develop a ""School Notice Notification App"". In addition, the project seemed to go smoothly, presenting various functions to be implemented, such as favorites, push notification, and history functions. However, due to the small number of team members of 3, it was difficult to proceed with the project, and to make matters worse, the announcement date was two weeks later. Although there were conflicts of opinion among team members due to limited time and heavy workload, they did not give up, and they mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and distributed tasks together. As a result, through systematic division of labor and schedule management, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time. Through this project experience, I realized the importance of systematic division of labor and schedule management, and above all, I was able to cultivate a sense of cooperation by striving to achieve a common goal. When I conducted a team project while taking the liberal arts course of the ""Team Project led by a team leader with a self-righteous personality,"" I had a difficult experience because of the team leader who did not know how to care and worked on the team project. In the process of sharing opinions, the team leader ignored and refused to accept the opinions of the team members if he had different opinions from himself, and proceeded with the project by sticking to his own opinions. As a result, all of the team members became dissatisfied with the team leader, and eventually lost interest in the project and ruined the project. Based on the importance of consideration and communication learned through this experience, I will strive to make all members of the organization become one of the common goals of corporate development at Hanwha S&C. By combining the perspective of optimization that industrial engineering aims for and the practical experience of the IT job, I made the following efforts to become a talented person suitable for the application operation job. First, in order to provide optimal IT services to customers in various industries, an understanding of the customer's industry must be the basis. As an industrial engineering student, I dealt with various fields and developed the perspective of optimization and problem-solving ability. In addition, by studying my major, I improved my understanding of information systems. I have developed the ability to design the system architecture and database, model requirements and processes, and visualize through UML. Based on this, I challenged the information processing engineer, passed the written test, and am about to take the practical test. Second, I gained practical experience through internships and acquired IT skills by dealing with Java, Oracle, and JSP. In addition, I learned to work with a large number of people to effectively achieve the common goal and the responsibility of performing the tasks of individuals within the organization to the end. Third, I developed my communication skills through student meetings and improved my ability to identify needs with customers through sales sales. In addition, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners through language training. Since I have these capabilities, I am confident that I am suitable for the job of operating an application that requires me to communicate with customers in various fields and accurately grasp the needs of customers. ICT technologies such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things are converging into existing technologies and services or combining them with new technologies in various fields to connect products and services through a network, intelligentize things, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution is emerging as a major topic in the industry. Through this, technologies and services are becoming more 'SMART', and as technology evolves, the needs of customers that change in various and complex ways are becoming 'CREATIVE'. In order not to be eliminated from the current IT industry, I think it is essential to develop more SMART and CREATIVE technologies and services in line with rapidly changing trends. While taking the information system analysis design, I proceeded with a project to improve and model the school's integrated system U-Dream's. Our team found it inconvenient that updates on service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition were made only in a face-to-face manner among the functions of the system. This was improved in a non-face-to-face manner in which when the student uploaded the documents to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and processed them every day for approval, and the manager updated the academic information, which was applied to the actual school integration system and gave a great sense of achievement. Just as we implement a SMART system with a CREATIVE posture, rather than just passing the inconvenience of daily life, we will be a member of Hanwha S&C that realizes greater value with a SMART&CREATIVE posture."
"""Developer who gives convenience"" My goal is to become a developer who turns the prevalent inconveniences into convenience. For example, when I was an undergraduate, I was able to provide convenience to myself and my classmates through the ""Introduction to Coverage Management System."" I felt proud of myself for development through this experience, and I thought that I would like to continue living as a developer with that mindset. As a developer of AhnLab, it would be security if I could think about what would meet my goals. But I don't think the general public can even feel the convenience because security doesn't show itself to the users directly. So, I may think that it doesn't meet my goal. However, I think that I can contribute as a developer who can indirectly give ""the convenience of safety"" by developing a Beckend of security software. Through this, I will become a developer 'OOO' who can contribute to AhnLab while achieving my goal. As time goes by, I will focus on discovering business by converging next-generation technologies into industries from startups to large companies. From this point of view, the need for a cloud that minimizes costs such as infrastructure construction, operation, and management, and increases productivity will greatly increase. In addition, general companies are also attempting to transform into IT companies through digital transformation. That's why the cloud market will become more active. What the cloud needs is 'security'. Currently, most companies are pursuing a private cloud. This is due to high security anxiety about public cloud. At this point, AhnLab developed a 'remote security control service' responsible for the security of the IBM cloud and is leading the security industry in the cloud market, such as being selected as the technical part of AWS. Therefore, if we continue to focus on cloud-based security businesses, we will be able to increase our competitiveness as a security company. I have experience in leading a project successfully by showing a sense of responsibility ""responsibility, the reason I was able to complete the project."" While working for the development club Nexters, I realized that individual responsibility is important for collaboration. At that time, the project did not progress because everyone was busy. So, I silently sent interim results on Back-End development, presented questions about ideas in the group chat room, and forced the project by matching API parameters with client developers. As a result, I developed it by dividing the time without my team members while watching myself working hard, and on weekends, I gathered and developed it for 8 hours. As a result, I was able to be selected as an excellent team within the club. Through this experience, I realized that individual responsibility can be helpful in order to draw out sincere cooperation from team members. I will become a talented person who can increase teamwork with a sense of responsibility, always thinking that it is my job. With the goal of becoming a ""challenge spirit"" Back-End developer, I found and challenged myself what I could do now. As a result, I built up my Back-End development capabilities through internship, development club, and seminar activity, and participated in hackathon to achieve the excellence award. I learned Java and Spring through the ""job experience"" intern, and Python and Django through the development club. I also learned how to develop cloud-based Back-End through attending AWS seminar. In addition, I have developed collaboration skills by utilizing Slack, Trello, Git, and Jenkins, and communication skills through development experiences with other occupations such as designers and planners. ""Active growth"" I have the strength of making efforts on my own to improve my own skills. For example, I have experience not only organizing knowledge learned through learning or experience, but also applying it to my own code and repecting it. I will always learn and grow on my own."
"Doosan is growing rapidly based on its outstanding technological prowess that leads the global market beyond the domestic market. Behind Doosan's growth in this way, I believe Doosan Information and Communication is supporting efficient IT systems. Information systems help departments that are physically and conceptually distant to perform their tasks by organically cooperating with them. This interest in information systems deepened when I took the information system analysis design, my major. It was attractive that the work environment, which naturally was used, was infused with efforts using IT technology. As a talented person who challenges new things with more curiosity than fear, I learned from Doosan Information and Communication, which provides advanced IT services and leads Doosan's growth, and with the passion to create a proud Doosan in the world with expertise. My strength is 'truthfulness'. When I work, I check every little part to see if things are going well. 'Is this enough?' This is what I said the most when I worked part-time at Subway. When I was making sandwiches to meet customers' needs, I asked their opinions and checked their satisfaction thoroughly. As a result, I gained regular customers, which led to increased sales. My meticulousness will be the driving force behind me in performing well without making a mistake because I have to perform small tasks well in any big task. On the other hand, it has the disadvantage of not being able to easily reject a request because I have a lot of affection. I almost missed the deadline for my assignment while helping another friend with an assignment. Since then, I have tried to compensate for my shortcomings by prioritizing and proceeding with consideration of the deadline and required time of the task when others ask for help. In the first semester of the 3rd year of the ""Team Project that successfully completed despite limited time and small number of team members"", I had the experience of improving the U-Dream, an integrated system of Dongguk University, as a team project by taking an information system analysis design, which is a mandatory subject for my major. The problem that our team came up with was that there are time and space constraints that require you to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department in order to input and modify service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition among the functions of the integrated system. We looked at this from the user's point of view and tried to systematically improve it. Instead of a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original document directly to the department through a meeting, when the student uploaded the document to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and approved it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which academic information was updated. However, the small number of team members, such as three, made it difficult to proceed with the project. To make matters worse, the presentation date was two weeks later, and due to the limited time and heavy workload, there were conflicts of opinion among team members. Despite difficult circumstances, we mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and evenly distributed tasks. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time of two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of fulfilling my goals by responding passionately without giving up. In addition, it was rewarding as the part that was improved with the project was applied to the system later. With the cooperative spirit cultivated through the team project, we will try to make all members of the organization one of the common goals of corporate development in Doosan."
"CJ's new distribution business is leading the globalization of Korean culture by exporting various products and brands from Korea to overseas. Behind the growth of the new distribution business like this, I believe CJ Olive Networks is supporting an efficient work environment. I think the company is another starting point in my life. So, when I select a company, I think about whether it is a company that can achieve sustainable growth rather than just looking at the current situation. In this regard, CJ Olive Networks is realizing customer satisfaction by providing optimal IT services and is continuously growing. In addition, it is not complacent at the present time, but has an innovative vision of 'DIGITAL NO.1 SMART VALUE CREATOR', and I think there are more ways to go than up the road. 'Industrial engineering students who know the importance of systems' information systems are important systems that help numerous departments that are separated by conceptual and physical distance organically cooperate to perform their tasks. Only when a good system is in place so that the company's efforts to achieve its goals work effectively, it can conduct its work efficiently and generate profits. Interest in such information systems deepened when I took the information system analysis design, which is a department class. It was attractive that efforts using IT technology were permeated into the work environment that was naturally used. In order to perform the system operation task, I have the following knowledge. First, I majored in industrial engineering and took major courses in various fields such as distribution and IT, so I have the ability to solve problems from a broad perspective. My competence as an industrial engineering student will be the basis for understanding the customer's business and suggesting the optimal alternative. Second, I developed my collaboration skills through student council and improved my communication skills with customers through sales. In addition, through language training, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners. This will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction through smooth communication. ""Excellent intern achieved in the posture of learning"" I have experience working as an intern in the web development part of the R&D team through long-term field training. Without much knowledge of web development, my first job as designing bulletin boards was not easy. However, I constantly tried to build up the knowledge necessary for my work and was able to write the continuously advanced code. At first, it was simply implemented in the JAVA Console window, but after that, the database was connected using the bulletin board ERD and JDBC, and the code was modified by applying the Connection Pool to reduce the load on the database. In addition, I learned and applied JSP, and wrote the continuously advanced code. As a result, I was able to implement the final answer-type bulletin board. Realizing that I was lacking while working on other tasks, I borrowed books from senior researchers to learn, take internet lectures, and make efforts to solidify basic skills in order to gain knowledge about web development such as JAVA, DB SQL, JSP, and JDBC during personal time outside of work hours. As a result, I was able to complete the tasks that I had decided to do during the field training earlier than expected, and I had the opportunity to participate in the Hazardous Blocking Service project that I was conducting with the Office of Education at the suggestion of a senior researcher. In addition, after the internship period was over, the school awarded scholarships to me because I received good reviews from the company. I felt that the ceaseless effort to make up for my shortcomings with a learning attitude was an indispensable virtue for me to improve myself. I gained two things from this experience. First, it was my experience in IT practice. It was a great experience to see, hear, feel, and deeply understand IT tasks in the field as well as my knowledge of web development. Second, it is a sense of challenge that does not avoid difficult tasks. I will become a new employee of CJ Olive Networks, which remembers the progress I made as an intern, passionately challenging all tasks, and takes on the learning attitude. As CJ Group provides lifestyle-oriented services such as CGV and Olive Young, it maintains a very high public recognition and market share. However, I learned that CJ Olive Networks' market share in Korea is less than 2 percent. I will raise its market share to the 10% level by 2027 with CJ Olive Networks, which strives to improve its market share through continuous IT innovation and maximization of IT efficiency. ""Customer trust determines CJ Olive Networks' future."" It is the customers that have led CJ Olive Networks today. The future of CJ Olive Networks will also depend on how many customers trust and use CJ Olive Networks. I will practice two things to gain customer trust. First, I will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction service by insighting the customer's needs as well as potential wants. I have experience in securing customers by making sandwiches according to customers' needs and grasping not only needs but also wants. We achieved an increase in sales by securing regular customers by satisfying the needs of customers who do not put vegetables they dislike and wants to add more vegetables they like. Second, we will contribute to providing standardized services to customers by creating standard operation procedures based on work experience and IT knowledge. I have experience working as a field manager at CJ CGV and trained on the importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). If we handle customer requirements according to SOP, we can systematically handle homogeneous tasks so that we can make decisions and respond quickly to situations. In addition, we will be able to gain customer trust by providing consistent service. 'When members of an organization grow, companies grow together.' This is the organizational values I have. I will continue to develop myself with these values and become an employee who continues to grow with CJ Olive Networks."
"""Global leader achieved through passion"" The three months of language training in Canada, which was short but full of experiences, are unforgettable experiences. Before going on language training, I set my goal to come back with the best experience that I could not forget even though it was a short period of time. In order to realize my goal, I made a small group called ""Enjoy Canada"" with my friends from the language school. I made a small group and tried to make fun memories by inviting friends of various nationalities. However, the operation was not as easy as various people gathered together. There were two major problems. First, it was a language barrier. Most of my friends were not fluent in English, so I had a hard time getting to know each other by having conversations with friends who mainly spoke the same language. In order to solve this problem, I first led conversations about my poor English skills and promoted friendship. Second, it was the difference of cultures. In order to understand the different cultures of each country, I tried to have time to exchange cultures. Especially, I made a time to teach drinking culture in Korea by drinking soju at Korean restaurants. This was a great response from my foreign friends, so I had a chance to get closer to my foreign friends. The proactive attitude to make good memories hanging out with friends I've never seen in a strange country has not only improved my English skills but also improved my communication skills and developed me into a global leader. SK Hynix's IT jobs are to propose, design, build, and maintain optimal systems. In order to build an optimal system, requirements must be investigated and analyzed, and in the process, I believe that communication skills are a virtue as important as competence in IT technology. I will try to provide the optimal system based on smooth communication. ""100-meter Runner's Challenge to Enter Engineering College"" Due to my athletic career, I started my day on the field unlike other friends and spent most of my time on the field. I started studying in high school and quit athletics due to frequent injuries, so I started studying for college entrance. I started studying late, but I set my goal of going to a four-year university in Seoul since I started doing it. In order to achieve my goal, I tried with physical strength and persistence developed by exercising more than other friends, thinking about ""one more hour, one more."" At first, I asked my homeroom teacher for help because I didn't know how to study. My teacher recommended me to study anew from the middle school course, and I built my foundation by studying from the middle school course. At first, it was difficult because I didn't seem to see any progress in my studies, but I didn't give up and continued to get better grades every time on the test. As a result of my efforts, I was able to achieve good grades in my university exams. Through this experience, I have realized from experience that efforts are not betrayed. Since then, I have not given up even in difficult situations, and I am slowly working on small things and solving them through efforts. I will not give up on any difficulties I face while working at SK Hynix and contribute to building and operating an optimal IT environment. ""Open the customer's wallet"" ""Up-sell excellent OO"" This is my title that I wore for three consecutive months while working as an OO manager at OOO. In the case of the branch where I was, I found out that sales at the store rather than ticket sales have a greater impact on sales than at other branches because there were fewer visitors than at other branches from March to June and September to November, which is called the off-season. I worked together on the goal of the branch and achieved the customer price of 11,500 won when the average customer price of the combo nationwide was less than 10,000 won, and was selected as the best up-sell smiley face in the branch. The reason why I was able to achieve this customer price was not just because I sold hard as ordered by the customer, but because I identified the types of customers and induced up-sell accordingly. When the customers were lovers, we induced sales to women who were more sensitive to food than men, and in the case of the family, we conducted up-sell as children's promotional products focusing on children, or decided on the composition of combo products to be recommended according to the number of members, and up-sell was carried out accordingly. In addition, in the case of a single audience, we were able to increase the unit price of a combo and a single customer by inducing sales as a single product rather than an inexpensive combo. With this strategic sale, we were able to increase the customer price and were selected to be excellent smiley face. In addition, my sales method contributed to the increase in sales at the branch by affecting the motives of working together. Through this up-sell experience, I was able to quickly grasp the given situation and maximize the effectiveness of my work. Even after joining the company, I will become a member of SK Hynix, which constantly builds and operates an optimal IT environment based on differentiated thoughts. ""From the unique presentation method through role play to winning the award,"" I received a silver award for introducing a differentiated presentation method called role play with three team members in a technical report preparation and presentation competition under the theme of ""RFID Technology."" In the process of preparing for the presentation, I thought it would be difficult to understand only after hearing the presentation about the technology I first encountered, so I thought a lot about the presentation method. After thinking about it, I suggested to the team members what it would be like to proceed with the role play as part of the parts necessary for technology and participate in the presentation together. However, the team members refused to do so due to the fear of the presentation and the fact that it would take a long time to prepare. I persuaded them by presenting this as a role play once and presenting it in front of the team members in the existing presentation method, and I was able to gain the consent of the team members. As a result, through our differentiated presentation method, we were able to attract students' attention and help most students understand. In addition to this, I was selected as a class representative and received a silver award by participating in a presentation competition hosted by the engineering college. Through these experiences, I was able to experience the importance of trying a creative approach and having a differentiated competitiveness from others.In addition, no matter what I do afterwards, I am trying to bring out better results by finding new ways without having a stereotype. I have experience as an intern in the web development part of the R&D team through a long-term field training program that I participated in to gain experience in the job of ""Excellent Intern achieved in the posture of learning."" The first task of designing a bulletin board was not easy for me, as I did not have much knowledge of web development. However, in order to gain knowledge necessary for work, I borrowed books from senior researchers to learn, take Internet lectures, and make constant efforts to solidify basic skills, and I was able to write continuously advanced codes. At first, it was simply implemented in the JAVA Console window, but a database was built using bulletin board ERD and Oracle, and it was connected to the bulletin board using JDBC. In addition, the code was modified by applying the Connection Pool to reduce the load on the database. Finally, by applying JSP, I was able to finally implement an answerable bulletin board. After that, as a result of continuous learning and continuous effort in the given task with a learning attitude, I was able to complete the tasks that were supposed to be carried out during the field training faster than expected, and I had the opportunity to participate in the hazard prevention service project that I was conducting with the Office of Education at the suggestion of a senior researcher. In addition, after the internship period was over, the school awarded me a scholarship because I received good evaluation from the company. In this process, I felt that the constant effort to make up for my shortcomings with a learning attitude was an indispensable virtue for developing oneself. I gained two things from this experience. First, my experience in IT practice. I was able to see, hear, feel, and deeply understand the IT job as well as my knowledge of web development. Second, it is a sense of challenge that does not avoid difficult tasks. I will become a new employee of SK Hynix, remembering the progress I made with a learning attitude, and passionately challenging all tasks and working with a learning attitude. I have made consistent efforts to become a talented person suitable for my IT job as follows. First, while majoring in industrial engineering, I tried to take various major courses and have a broad perspective. Your competence as an industrial engineer will be the basis for understanding the whole industry and suggesting the best alternative. Second, I completed the ABEEK in Engineering Education Certification Course and carried out team projects in various subjects such as information system analysis design, service engineering, and management information system. Through this team project, I learned a sense of responsibility to perform the tasks assigned by individuals in the organization to the end and how to cooperate with a large number of people to effectively achieve common goals. This experience in team projects will be helpful in solving situations that I experience while working on practical tasks after joining SK Hynix. Third, I developed my collaboration skills through student council and improved my communication skills with customers through sales sales. In addition, I have grown into a global talent who is not afraid to communicate with foreigners through language training. It will contribute to realizing customer satisfaction through smooth communication. Through the knowledge and practical experience acquired during my undergraduate years, my goal is to become an IT expert who can operate all systems within five years. ""Team Project Successfully Completed Despite Limited Time and Few Team Members"" In the first semester of the third year, I had experience in team projects by taking information system analysis design, which is a mandatory subject for my major. Our team carried out the project with the aim of improving and modeling our school's integrated system, OOO. The problem that our team came up with was that among the functions of the OOO system, there are time and space constraints that require the person to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department in a limited time for entry and correction of service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the contest. We tried to improve this systematically from a user's point of view. When a student uploads the document to the storage and requests approval through a meeting, rather than a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original copy directly to the department, the teacher and staff checked it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which the academic information was updated. However, the project was difficult due to the small number of team members of three. To make matters worse, the set presentation date was two weeks later, and due to limited time and heavy workload, there was also a conflict of opinion among team members. However, we did not give up, mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules together, and distributed each task evenly. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project with limited time and a small number of people, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of passionately coping with the goal without giving up. In addition, what we improved with the project was applied to OOOO later, and it was improved and rewarding. With the teamwork cultivated through the team project, SK Hynix will strive to become one of the common goals of corporate development."
"""Growth process - responsible person, OOO"" My parents always told me that being responsible for my actions is the most important factor in living. Influenced by my parents, I have also always tried to be a responsible person. When I was a child, I was on my way to the pharmacy to buy medicine for my sick sister, and I met my friend and played with her, but I forgot my purpose and came home empty-handed late. When I came home, my sister, who was waiting for her medicine, had a fever. I felt guilty when I saw my condition deteriorated due to my actions, and my parents begged me that promises are important, no matter how trivial, and that I should always act with responsibility. As a young me, at first I simply had the concept of feeling sorry for my sister and responsibility because I didn't want to be scolded by my parents. However, growing up, I realized that if I act responsibly every moment, I will achieve results that match, so I made responsibility my life belief. I want to contribute to the continuous profit creation of the company by taking advantage of various projects and IT internship experience in system development and maintenance. I will become a system expert who contributes to the development of the company by developing and providing systems by always putting the value of my customers first and using responsibility, which is my main weapon. ""Internship - I will drive the growth of the company based on my attitude of learning and practical experience."" I challenged the internship to experience the practice with the expectation and enthusiasm that I want to learn more than the existing knowledge and become a more professional talent. Through this, I worked as an intern in the R&D team for 4 months at OOOO and planned and developed a customer management web project. During the first month, I planned the overall structure and design of the project by drawing a storyboard while building a development environment. In the process of developing after finishing planning, I had difficulties because it was my first time developing the web. However, with the passion to learn, I sought advice from senior researchers, and constantly tried to learn by myself through Internet lectures and books to develop my job understanding skills. Based on what I learned, after linking Java with Oracle using MyBatis, I implemented functions such as registration, modification, deletion, and inquiry of customer information, wrote continuously advanced code, and I was able to develop a customer management web page. I have such a passion to challenge myself to learn new knowledge and develop existing knowledge. Based on my job understanding skills gained through internships, I will quickly and accurately understand the work and demonstrate practical skills to enhance the performance of the work. In addition, I will always learn and challenge in a humble manner, and take the lead in driving the growth of the company. ""Team Project - Team Project that successfully completed despite limited time and few team members"" In the first semester of the third year, I took an information system analysis design, which is a required subject of my major, and improved Eudreams, an integrated system of OO University, as a team project. The problem that our team came up with was that there are time and space constraints that require you to submit the original copy directly to the relevant department for input and correction of service hours, external activities, and award-winning entries in the competition among the functions of the integrated system. We looked at this from the user's point of view and tried to improve it systematically. Instead of a face-to-face method in which the student must submit the original document directly to the department through a meeting, when the student uploaded the document to the storage and requested approval, the faculty and staff checked and approved it every day, and the administrator decided to improve the system in a non-face-to-face manner in which academic information was updated. However, the small number of team members, such as three, made it difficult to proceed with the project. To make matters worse, the presentation date was two weeks later, and due to the limited time and heavy workload, there were conflicts of opinion among team members. Despite difficult circumstances, we mediated the opinions of team members, planned schedules, and evenly distributed tasks. The project was carried out through systematic division of labor and schedule management, and as a result, we were able to successfully complete modeling, reports, and presentations within a limited time of two weeks. There were many difficulties in carrying out the project, but I felt a great sense of accomplishment in the process of fulfilling my goals by responding passionately without giving up. In addition, it was rewarding as the part that was improved with the project was applied to the system later. With the cooperative spirit cultivated through the team project, we will strive to unite all members of the organization under the common goal of corporate development. ""Cooperation - Consideration and Communication for Consensus"" In the process of planning a festival as a representative of the grade, I believe that consideration and communication are the center of collaboration and I have experience in drawing consensus points from student council organizations. Since the festival is one of the university events that students look forward to the most, we have made different resolutions to plan an event that satisfies everyone. However, in the process of sharing opinions through meetings, it was difficult to coordinate opinions due to differences in positions of each department. The general affairs department had a conflict by raising profitability, the planning department by raising students' interest, and the chairman and vice chairman had an external aspect, and it was expected that it would take a lot of time to reach an agreement. To solve this problem, we set a schedule for future meetings and asked each department to present guidelines after sufficient meetings before then. Afterwards, based on the guidelines, we continued to mediate opinions to hold events that satisfy everyone, emphasizing consideration and understanding with each other, and were able to reach an agreement that students could satisfy within the budget. I think the reason why we disagree even within the same organization is that we have different responsibilities. As a result, I experienced that it was possible to accurately grasp each responsibility and requirement, consider each other's position, and communicate with each other, and derive satisfactory results. I will become a new employee who finds an agreement and promotes smooth work by drawing consideration and communication from people from various positions.""Challenge - Language Study with Your Own Money"" When I was undergraduate, I planned to study the language to gain various experiences. It was not easy to raise funds for language study from students, but I set a challenging goal to ease the burden on my parents and go there with my own money for a more meaningful experience. With the passion of achieving my goals, I worked part-time and planned to save about 150,000 won per month. I am sometimes tempted and unable to carry out my plans, so I am used to keeping short-term plans, but I realized that I lack practical skills to keep long-term plans. As a result of saving money separately and making efforts to live with the rest of my life, I was able to collect 10 million won in Canadian language study. Through this experience, I realized the importance of goals and the passion to achieve them. After going through language study, I set goals thoroughly, made a habit of planning and putting them into practice in order to achieve them, and I ended up living a more planned and targeted life."
"When choosing a company or job, I choose based on two criteria. First, is it the company that can best demonstrate my capabilities? I was trained in the Big Data Manager course organized by the IT OOOO Association, and learned JAVA, Oracle, and Hadoop through the training. And based on this, I worked on four team projects with people from other majors, such as humanities, statistics, and others, not with my majors. Through this experience of collaboration, I was able to gain practical communication skills and development-related skills through development experience. CJ Olive Networks is conducting its business by applying big data to the marketing and distribution sectors, and its future direction of development is the fusion of more diverse fields and big data technologies. I thought that I could best match the capabilities I have developed in the development of big data processing systems, which will become more and more important to CJ. Second, is it a company that I can learn from? When I was a freshman, I joined a programming club to improve my programming skills. By using basic education and public lecture time, I developed my programming skills through information exchange about programming with seniors. After joining the company, I will grow through learning and become a member of CJ Olive Networks, which contributes to the development of the CJ Olive Networks system. I participated in and challenged the Campus OO Strategy Universiade. First, the main components of the patent were analyzed to understand the patent and technology in question. However, there was a limit to understanding the technology at the company level. So, I searched for basic books related to technology and studied them deeply, and tried to understand the technology by reading explanations on the background technology in hundreds of papers. Then, I found related patents and papers based on the technology analysis. I found a total of five core prior art documents related to this patent out of thousands of patents obtained by searching the main components of the patent with keywords. Since the patent in question was a U.S. patent, I was able to find a product from Cisco that is highly likely to have infringed on this patent as a result of persistent review of the data sheets of the products related to this patent by the leading communication companies in the U.S. And, judging that there is a possibility that this patent may be invalidated through the prior art documents, I suggested an avoidance design that constitutes the patent by changing the core parts that may be infringed in a different way. Through the total analysis, we found the possibility of other prior patent infringement as well as the product that infringed on the company's patents. Through this experience, when I encounter difficulties after joining CJ Olive Networks, I will make plans and overcome them with a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm as if I had set up procedures to solve the problem, rather than running into them recklessly. I would like to join CJ Olive Networks and challenge to develop and operate a customized system that accurately predicts and provides services and products needed by customers by analyzing the data of customers and potential customers. At this time, I would like to develop a system based on a service with a story, not just a system. It is a service for customers who have targeted stories such as services that can be experienced with children by analyzing customer data, well-being O2O services for middle-aged people, products for children, and connection with camping-related services. For the DB analysis and system development of these services, in the short term and personally, I will further increase the capabilities of DB analysis. I would like to further develop practical skills through training such as the 'Database Manager Course', which is currently being trained, and in the long run, I would like to develop a customized system through the capacity of DB analysis and system development."
"""The convergence and collaboration skills that I have learned over the past two years"" I believe that the two strengths that I can confidently say are superior to other applicants are the convergence and collaboration skills, which correspond to the talent IBM wants. When I was working on a project to reduce the waiting time at a children's hospital, even though I was an engineer, I also participated in the work of observing and discovering problems at the hospital for three days. By going to the field, I was able to discover unexpected parts in the desk research process, and by experiencing all processes from the planning stage to the solution stage with humanities and design majors, I was able to develop my collaboration skills. As such, I feel proud and attached to technology-based human-centered research, and I am confident that the experiences that I have solved head-to-head will be able to solve future problems together at IBM. In the future, I would like to serve as the first mover of ICT, emotional, and design convergence technologies that bring out the ability to communicate according to the changing demands of the times based on user experience rather than technology. I became interested in Watson through a webinar conducted in April, and I had the experience of presenting a paper to the Korean Design Association a month later using a Watson API demo. The topic of the paper is ""Professional of Interactive Language Learning System (ILS) using ICT Technology,"" and the experiment was conducted using Watson's Visual Recognition, Text to Speech demo, which shows high recognition rate. Currently, I am testing a demo application on Android using TensorFlow, and I am reading papers related to deep learning every day to increase recognition rate. Last semester, I studied classification algorithms such as SVM and statistics through data mining class. Since June, I have participated in the research project ""Study for environmental performance and precision in fingerprinting and PDR technologies for indirect location estimation."" Since it is in the early stages of research, I am looking for related studies, and finally, the final goal is to estimate the indoor location more accurately and robustly through the deep learning process for wireless signals. In the 4th Industrial Revolution, IBM companies with cloud computing technology will change our world. I think cloud computing is at the highest level among all related technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, cloud computing, big data, mobile, and blockchain. Since the Internet of Things is also data-based, we will use IBM's cloud computing service, which collects data at a lower level and provides cloud services. Likewise, artificial intelligence will depend on cloud computing capabilities because it depends on how data is processed, classified, and interpreted. In the end, only companies with a lot of data will be given the opportunity to provide all of the above services, and I think we can lead the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. There is not much time left when you will meet scenes that you have only seen in science fiction movies in real life. Even now, you can see them applied to your life one by two. I want to make the imaginary characters a reality with IBM. You can experience the design process and empathize with the design sensibility. It may be ironic that engineering majors are studying design, but I studied UX design because I thought it would be difficult to produce good products without going through the UX design process, which recognizes humanities values and emotions rather than technology in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. With the convergence of engineering-based core technology development learned while majoring in in information and communication electronics engineering, as well as research in the HCI and UX fields in graduate schools, we have the ability to efficiently develop mobile applications based on user experience in the future. Core technology will be included in all products and services, but the final end point for technology will be people. It will be better research if we understand and develop human contexts from the R&D stage. IBM already has world-class technology, so if research on humans, humans, and humans is conducted at the same time, it will be a recognized company until the end."
"As part of my employment activities, I made ceaseless efforts to obtain a certificate. I currently have a computer graphics operation technician, a web design technician, and an information processing technician/driver. As a computer major, I believe that obtaining an information processing certificate will be of great help to your computer system management. And I think that the graphics operation technician and the web design technician will be able to enhance the visual convenience of your company's web page production and management. In the case of English, I am taking TOEIC on a regular basis to improve my grades, and I plan to increase it to more than 800 points in the future. The main task of KEPCO KDN (hereinafter referred to as kdn) is to 'manufacture and manage overall computer systems of KEPCO and its affiliates'. For the efficient power control and management of KEPCO, a parent company, the role of kdn in charge of computer systems between companies, that is, websites and related software, is important. I believe that I can contribute to your computer management by reflecting this role of kdn. This is because, by obtaining a computer major and information processing technician license, I have a faster overall understanding of the computer system than other non-acquired people. Having obtained a computer graphics operating technician and a web design technician license, I believe that I can play a major role in visual convenience and intuitive interface, which are important for managing web pages. No matter how capable you are of creating a complete website with only web programming languages and text coding tools, lack of design aesthetic and visual layout will make users uncomfortable when browsing the website. It was when I was working on my graduation project. There were originally a total of three members in my team, including two members of the group, but the problem was that one of the group members was employed, but the problem was that they did not appear on the day of the mid-term course presentation or important interviews with the professor at all, and did not try to take on important roles such as programming or design, but only handed it over to me as the team leader. Also, one member of the other group also neglected to pass on all the tasks to me on the excuse that he had learned nothing. So I was faced with two difficulties, and I was wondering whether to persuade them to share roles and go with me to the end or to withdraw the team members. It was uncertain whether the team members who had no will would make the work properly if they led as it was, and on the contrary, if they withdrew the team members, there was a risk of being deducted from the group cooperation score. So I consulted the professor about this, called the team members, talked about it, then withdrew the already employed student, found what I could do and let the remaining one participate in the project. Fortunately, that judgment helped to go smoothly and I was able to complete it safely. As part of improving my professionalism, I made ceaseless efforts to obtain certification. I currently have computer graphics management technicians, web design technicians, information processing technicians, and information processing technicians, and I was originally interested in visual design as the reason for obtaining these certifications. In order to pioneer such a career path, I acquired a graphics management technician and a web design technician, and obtained an information processing license as a way to make use of my major subject in the future. As a computer major, I believe that obtaining an information processing license will be of great help to your computer system management, and I believe that graphics management and web design technicians will be able to enhance the visual convenience of your company's web page creation and interest. And speaking of school education, I have enhanced my understanding of the computer system you require by taking major subjects such as logic circuit, algorithm, operating system, computer structure, database, and software engineering, and by obtaining compliance credits for those subjects. I am sure that my experience will be helpful to you. As far as I know, employees of public corporations and public institutions are the face of the state. Their facial expressions, tone, and behavior are all visible to customers every day. Also, I think that the people indirectly judge the image of the government and the state and trust the government accordingly. In other words, I think that their office skills, service to customers, and public relations between individual employees are clearly linked to the trust of the people. This lack of ethical consciousness follows just from the irregularities within state agencies that occasionally appear in the news. There is a fear that the public's trust in the state will be reduced by watching such news, and that they will distrust the state and the government. Therefore, public officials should act carefully anytime, anywhere, with the mindset that they are truly an example for the people before these things happen. Above all, I think the attitude of making public affairs clear is the top priority for public officials."
"I learned how to meet various people and understand the differences by doing activities such as general student council, overseas travel, internship, overseas education volunteer work, etc., not just staying in the ""Athlet of Growth."" Experiences that may seem like a waste of time to someone required cooperation and communication, and were very helpful in the progress of development projects that needed to come up with appropriate solutions through quick understanding. As the project team leader, I was able to lead my team members without much conflict and achieve higher performance than others. In addition, while working as a research club for four years, I have been working on mobile, VR, and embedded projects, and have completed portfolios in various fields, not limited to one field. Through constant research in one field, I also published two papers and got the opportunity to present them at conferences. In addition, I participated in IT forums such as Han-eum, SOSCON, and the world IT competition to broaden my perspective on rapid technological trends. With these experiences, I want to grow further in the Korean Music Copyright Association and be with them. Due to the influence of my parents who like music, ""A Stage to Communicate"" I have lived a daily life since I was young. I have always dreamed of a career in music, but I majored in software for my career. However, while majoring in IT, I wanted to work in a field related to music that was daily, and I wanted to be a developer who provided value beyond just providing services. At first, I wondered if I could work in two areas that seemed completely unrelated. However, I was able to resolve my doubts by seeing the seniors who already work for the Korea Music Copyright Association and their confidence. So, I applied without hesitation to the Korea Music Copyright Association, which judged it to be the right stage for the field I was looking for. And in order to become a developer who can stand on that suitable stage, I will constantly improve to keep up with the ever-improving future path of the IT field. During the internship period of the ""Developer in-depth"" I had the opportunity to work on a project by myself from beginning to end. I planned a daycare center application and developed it for a month. As the development progressed, users varied even in one system, so analysis of users was needed to meet the needs of each user within one function. One of the implementation functions was the notification slip. I found that contacting parents outside of working hours was a burdensome part for teachers, but it was one of the essential parts for parents. After that, I thought of an intermediate point in which each user's needs could be all reflected. In the process, the notification slip function, which was previously planned in chat format, was changed into a bulletin board format and developed. After that, I made a final presentation on the project in front of the incumbent developers, and I was able to receive favorable reviews for developing the system that was considered from the perspective of each user. Above all, I was able to hear the unforgettable and valuable saying, ""Developer in depth."" ""I will continue to grow."" For the three years after joining the company, I will become a new employee who is not afraid of questions and works hard to understand the company-wide work and system as well as the duties given with an attitude of learning, acceptance, and challenge. In addition, I want to become an employee who makes sure the basics through constant learning and is proud of the company like my seniors. Through my accumulated experience, I will quickly judge the elements that need the system, maintain and repair the solutions required within them, and provide an optimized system for the user's point of view. And I will be an employee who plays a central role in leading the solutions to be provided in an efficient direction. In 10 years, I want to design solutions so that the services I develop and provide can be conveniently used by anyone, and I want to become a respected developer and a leading developer who can lead the team members who are working on the project, and this is my ultimate goal as a developer."
"""I am a developer with a spirit of challenge that does not give up."" He did not give up and challenged more than 20 times to win in four contests. I participated in related contests to experience the planning and development process with my team members through startup club activities. When I first challenged the contest, I thought that if I challenged with only good ideas, I could achieve results, so I simply participated in the contest. We analyzed the problems of eliminating 20 contests with our team members, and we participated in the contest by making sure to observe the following two points. First, a market analysis meeting was held every week to identify market issues and suggest ideas to solve them. Second, we tried to identify and minimize development issues that occur during the development process. As a result of participating in the above two contests, we achieved the result of winning in four contests after 20 challenges. Based on these experiences, I will analyze the market and demonstrate my ability to minimize development issues. ""Necessity to secure an IT technology infrastructure for construction IT technological innovation"" With the development of information and communication technology, I think it is time for the construction IT field to also face a new turning point. Looking at the recent IT convergence innovation cases in the construction industry, we are pursuing innovation in the fields of smart construction, city, and living by introducing technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and IoT. In this process, before discussing the growth direction of lakeside construction, I would like to first mention the necessity of securing an IT technology infrastructure. The biggest reason why IT technology infrastructure must be secured is to establish a root that can act in line with the changes and development speed of the future construction IT industry. I think trees with strong roots have the power to withstand any changes. In order for lakeside construction to grow in line with the changing construction IT market, I think it is the direction to prepare for the future market and to establish basic IT infrastructure by securing development experts and original technologies for construction IT convergence. ""I am a developer with '○○'."" As I have grown as a developer, I have come to have a tenet of becoming a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I must possess as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is what I need the most no matter what I perform. During my start-up activities, I learned related technologies for 14 hours a day to learn Android technologies that I did not know well for app development. As a result, I showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete a task within a given time, I have grown up with a principle of becoming a responsible developer because I need to learn skills by performing additional tasks as needed and returning my own time."
"""We want to become a necessary root for the growth of LDCC."" Based on my experience and competence in internal and external activities that I participated in during my college life, I applied to become a root that contributes to the development of LDCC's production system. LDCC's differentiated system construction project, which integrally builds an optimal system suitable for various corporate environments, was an opportunity to apply for the job at LDCC. If I join LDCC, which is leading the SI industry, I am confident that it will be a root that contributes to the growth of LDCC based on various internal and external activity capabilities experienced during my college life. In addition, based on my experience in competitions, start-ups, and internship activities, I want to quickly learn the skills necessary for work and show results to become a root for LDCC growth. ""I am a developer with '○○'."" As I have grown as a developer, I have a tenet to become a responsible developer. Among the many competencies that I must have as a developer, I chose 'responsibility' because I think it is what I need most no matter what I perform. During my startup activities, I learned related skills for 14 hours a day to learn Android skills that I do not know well for app development. As a result, he showed a sense of responsibility to complete the development within the target time. In order to complete such tasks within the given time, it is necessary to perform additional tasks as needed and return his or her own time to learn skills, so he has grown with the principle of becoming a responsible developer. ""I will be a developer who catches data."" We will develop Lotte Group's continuous revenue solution by utilizing 46 integrated member information data in 4 fields generated by L.POINT. First, we will learn and learn big data analysis technologies such as Hadoop and R for statistical analysis for processing large amounts of data for 3 years after joining the company. Based on the technology, we will build a customized Lotte curation service through information integration and pattern analysis of the consumption and behavior patterns of Lotte Group members and external factors (weather, transportation) Open API. We will more than double the operating efficiency and operating profit by recommending the products of each affiliate according to our pattern. Through this, we will make all of Lotte's customers become VIP customers. If LDCC's technology and passion for developing my Big Data platform are added to the construction of Lotte Curation Service, I am confident that we will be able to make a first-class voyage that can catch hidden values in data within 10 years."
"I took a subject called Basic Creative Engineering Design during the undergraduate class of ""The IOT World Made with Samsung Electronics"". I made a presentation with the topic of research on future industries and was new to IOT. As a result of the research, I found out that it is a great promising technology for the future and that big foreign companies such as MS and SISCO are already investing a lot. As I got to know about IOT, I became more and more interested and dreamed of making a world where people can stay convenient by using IOT technology. Samsung Electronics has formed an IOT commercialization team to prepare for the upcoming IOT era. It is dominating the IOT platform market by developing ARTIK, an IOT platform with security solutions and cloud functions. With ARTIK, I think it will be able to quickly and easily commercialize IOT devices and expand its influence in the IOT platform market in the future to use Thales' sophisticated security solutions that solve the current weak security problems of IOT devices. I applied to achieve my dream of creating a convenient world by using Samsung Electronics' advanced IOT technology. In order to achieve my dream at Samsung Electronics, I will try to acquire advanced IOT technology early on. And in the long run, I will contribute to the global use of the ARTIC platform by optimizing the IOT platform technology. After discharging from the military, I served in a restaurant and worked part-time as a barista for two years. I didn't have any experience working part-time before, so I didn't get used to my job and made many mistakes. I thought about whether serving was inappropriate for me and wondered if I should find another job. One day, while I was thinking about it, when I made a mistake, the restaurant owner told me, ""It's okay. Everyone makes mistakes. No one is good from the beginning. Try hard."" Listening to the boss, I was able to get rid of the guilt of making a mistake, and I thought to give up and try hard. As time passed, I became better at serving and reduced a lot of mistakes. And I was able to become a barista as a dessert business skillfully. Among the part-timers I worked with, when I became the best, I was recognized by the boss and asked him to be the manager who manages the restaurant part-timers. Since then, I have decided to live my life in the future with the motto, 'Don't give up on anything and do your best.' And when it was time to return to school, I quit my part-time job at a restaurant and went to school. While attending, I studied my major hard, and I had the opportunity to participate in a contest. It was a project competition on the theme of IOT at an embedded research institute in the school, and I teamed up with my friends to participate. The detailed topic was 'Autonomous Driving of Electric Bicycles'. It was a project that autonomously maintained through Arduino signals by measuring the distance between bicycles with a mobile phone GPS when platooning of electric bicycles. A problem occurred while I was developing Arduino, who was in charge of the speed control part of the electric bicycle. I tried to adjust the speed value using the software of the electric bicycle, but there was a problem that the value could not be changed in real time due to compatibility problems between Arduino and the electric bicycle software. I thought a lot about solving the problem, but I came to the conclusion that it was difficult to solve it with the knowledge and technology I knew. However, if I couldn't implement the speed control function, I couldn't proceed with the project. Reflecting on my motto, 'Don't give up on anything and do your best,' I have tried various things that can be done outside the level of knowledge I know. I contacted the company of the electric bicycle I bought and tried to get information about the electronics and circuit diagrams of the electric bicycle. By analyzing the electronic circuit diagram and sending signals to the throttle and brake control part of the electric bicycle directly with Arduino, I was able to successfully control the speed of the electric bicycle and finish the project. Taking this experience as a springboard, I will try to find a way to solve any problems in my life without giving up. This capability will be the foundation for not giving up when faced with a problem after joining the company. ""Development of Self-Driving and Challenges to Solve"" In the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution, self-driving cars are becoming a hot topic. Overseas, automakers such as Apple, Tesla, and BMW are investing a lot to make self-driving cars. Also, domestic automakers such as Hyundai Motor are also investing a lot, and IT company Naver will also develop Level 3 autonomous cars and show them at the 2017 Seoul Motor Show. When commercialized according to the development of self-driving cars, there are several advantages. Many human-caused accidents such as drunk driving and signal violations can be prevented. And if self-driving is used for commuting or long-distance travel, it will make people's lives convenient, as it can reduce driver fatigue and make the time spent driving cars useful. Although there are such advantages of self-driving cars, there are still challenges to be solved. First, it is necessary to systematically set laws and regulations for self-driving cars. For example, if an accident occurs while using partial self-driving cars, it is necessary to systematically divide the responsibilities between the driver and the self-driving car company. Second, there is an ethical issue. In an autonomous vehicle, the judgment on driving is determined by the algorithm of a computer program or artificial intelligence. However, there is a problem when an unavoidable accident occurs with pedestrians while driving autonomously. Self-driving cars will have to choose whether to prioritize the safety of pedestrians or passengers over pedestrian safety.And in the event of such an accident, who is responsible will also be a problem. With the development of autonomous driving technology, there are many advantages that make life convenient, but there are challenges that need to be solved accordingly. We will have to quickly solve the challenges we are facing in order to create a more convenient society."
"[I tied the strings to my sneakers. I'm ready to run] I'm a cheetah. Just like a cheetah who rushes to snatch prey as soon as it's ready, once it's set, I accomplish my goal with all my might. Through this, I was able to obtain job-related certificates such as information processing technician and CCNA at once. In addition, when I was working on my team project, I was able to complete it in a given period of time through mutual cooperation. However, some people say that I'm cautious or persistent because I always focus on the present. To supplement this, I open up various possibilities and make plans and seek alternatives. In addition, when working on a team project, I listen to various opinions of my team members and try to proceed in a way that everyone agrees with. [Challenge Spirit and Passion Learned through Sports] When I have a given goal, I have the passion to challenge myself in a more serious manner than anyone else. This persistent attitude started out due to sports climbing that my father started. I started as an artificial rock wall and traveled to many places, including Insubong's natural rock wall, to climb the mountain. Sports climbing is a dangerous sport that stimulates the desire to compete with oneself. If there is someone who is ahead of you, you must have a bilay from below to climb the rock wall safely. That is why the person who holds the line from below can also be responsible and not focused, which can lead to a big accident. On the other hand, when climbing, you cannot reach the top unless you go up with perseverance and effort. This hobby of sports climbing has made me more responsible in relationships with others, and has the grit and perseverance to challenge myself without giving up on everything. [I will be a reliable shield] I will become a security controller who can safely defend against intrusion attacks in a situation where major corporate confidential and personal information is leaked, and customer damage is growing. I will become a team member who can build trust in customers and NIT services by becoming a shield that is strengthened by the window that attacks without stepping back while facing various situations after joining the company. When I was in college, I started working as an office worker at an academy. However, as rumors spread that he was good at fixing computers, he was asked to deal with problems in general. Rather than complaining, I thought it was a good opportunity to gain knowledge by dealing with various obstacles to the computer system, and I was able to expand my computer knowledge by dealing with problems ranging from hardware and software. Based on this experience, I will contribute to becoming a reliable company by enhancing my ability to adapt to the ever-changing environment even after joining the NIT Service. [I will grow into a professional security controller in the NIT Service Security Control Team.] Within one year after joining the company, the NIT Service Security Control Team will quickly adapt to the security control work and the environment so that I can create synergy through sincere communication and collaboration with others. Within five years after joining the company, I will strengthen my practical skills to increase the efficiency of my work as the security control project leader. System security and network security are the most important and fundamental in control, so I will prepare CISSP to check my current capabilities and make up for what I missed. Within 10 years of joining the company, I will give more educational opportunities through the experience and knowledge gained in practice to develop the expertise of the members of the security control team, and I will show myself taking the initiative in self-development. In addition, I will become a PM with expertise to implement the best solutions and solutions to the customer."
"I have the experience of developing an unmanned parking system for beginner drivers. I became interested in developing software because I felt a sense of accomplishment by implementing the functions I wanted and checking them with my own eyes. Through this, I learned the importance of 'customer orientation' and I think it is consistent with CJ Olive Networks' direction, which puts customers first. I think CJ Olive Networks, which realizes customer value in various fields, is the most suitable for improving its customer-oriented capabilities. [Unmanned Parking System for Beginner Drivers] In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using EV3 automobile robots. He always drives well, but the image of his mother calling his father because of the parking in the parking lot reminded me of 'unmanned parking'. First, we detected the parking line using the camera. Based on the location and number of the detected parking lines, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. We also added a convenient function. When parking directly in the dark at night, it was difficult to park because the wheels were not visible. To relieve this inconvenience, LEDs were installed next to the wheels. In dark situations, the LED turns on automatically, and the wheels are visible, creating a convenient parking environment. I gained A+ credits and user-oriented importance by listening to the professor's praise for placing importance on the automation system and user convenience. CJ Olive Networks provides IT services both inside and outside the group through various business areas such as food, distribution, and entertainment. Depending on the characteristics of the customer industry, we provide 'integrated management customized services' to promote customer innovation, create new business opportunities, and put customers first. I think the experience of creating a system for beginner drivers coincides with CJ Olive Networks' customer orientation. I applied to CJ Olive Networks because I wanted to realize customer value in various business areas based on synergy effects. The goal is to 'release services that I made myself and achieve results.' This is because I had done many projects when I was a undergraduate but had no experience in launching them myself. CJ Olive Networks SW users think of them as 'employees' and 'customers'. We will develop services for users by practicing the following growth roadmap. In the first year of joining the company, I will study the services of CJ Olive Networks. I will learn about the overall system by learning common service areas such as finance, HR, and mobile. In the third year, I will understand the work of CJ affiliates. We will improve the inconvenience of the system and support the work of the employees by developing a new internal system through biometric authentication. From the fifth year, we will apply new IT technologies. We will provide convenience to customers by intelligentizing all CJ systems by utilizing VR, AR, and artificial intelligence. We will take customer feedback and fix any shortcomings. I think the ability of 'communication' is important to achieve the goal. This is because we need to have a process of identifying and giving feedback on user needs to create user-oriented SW. I have experience in achieving my goal by listening to the opinions of my team members. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. As the leader in charge of training, I thought the reason why I could not perform well was because of a problem with the training method. We had a meeting every day and set the goal of advancing to the finals, and changed the training method as follows. First, some of the team members were freshmen who had never played a real game. The training method, which was focused on basic skills, was changed to focus on the actual game to develop a sense of practice. Second, unlike the previous one where all the members applied the same training method, the training method was divided by level to make up for the shortcomings. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I achieved a quarterfinal performance that exceeded my goal among 128 teams. After joining the company, I will develop customer-oriented SW with my team members by demonstrating my communication skills. The most meaningful example is the project experience that solved the problems of working mothers. This is because by developing a solution using the smart home system, a new IT technology, customer value was improved, and it led to the award. [Smart Home System for Working Moms] When I worked part-time at an academy, my main task was to ask and answer the phone whether the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and it was an opportunity to plan a smart home project that could keep the child safe at home alone, which is the biggest concern. As a development environment, C++ and JavaScript were used on Linux, and Android apps were created using Java. Among them, we built a web server and were in charge of post communication between Android and the web server. First, we constructed smart home devices for the safety of children in the house. We constructed gas valves, interphones, and air conditioners, and created a smartphone app called ""Please Take Care of a Working Mom"" so that working mothers can control these smart home devices with their smartphones. We also constructed them to do housework. By constructing refrigerators, fluorescent lamps, and distributor smart home devices, the role of working mothers who can pay attention to housework was highlighted. I, who will soon become a working father, also sympathized with the upcoming reality, so I was able to implement functions optimized for working mothers. Through this, we won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the Presidential Award at the In-school Graduation Work Competition with the sympathy of the judges. CJ Olive Networks is responding quickly to the needs of the market by developing new technologies that meet the latest IT trends. It operates smart systems equipped with automation functions such as smart factory integration platforms, smart logistics centers, and smart stores to improve service levels. I think smart home systems are another option. After joining the company, we will contribute to CJ Olive Networks' smart system by developing a 'smart home platform' that gives convenience and safety to customers through home monitoring."
"Samsung Electronics is focusing on products that enhance the usability and convenience of customers, such as smart TVs, smartphones, and Samsung Pay. In addition, through a lineup of products ranging from premium to entry-level, customers are broadening their choice, putting customer-oriented values first. I have experience in developing an 'unmanned parking' system for beginner drivers. I think this experience is consistent with Samsung Electronics' direction of putting customers first. [Development of an 'unmanned parking' system for beginner drivers] In the embedded computing system subject, a project was carried out using EV3 automobile robots. He always drives well, but I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in the parking lot, so I chose the theme as 'unmanned parking'. First, we detected the parking line using a camera. Based on the location and number of parking lines detected, we implemented a system that allows automatic parking by controlling the direction of the wheel motor. I got A+ credit and user-oriented importance from the professor's glowing review of the importance of user convenience. I think the experience of developing a system for beginner drivers is consistent with Samsung Electronics' 'customer orientation'. After joining the company, I will develop a platform that uses Samsung products smartly by developing a system that facilitates connection with digital devices. This will give convenience to customers and help expand the Samsung IoT ecosystem. [Start of Communication] The values of life are 'Let's communicate.' These values were able to form from the beginning of elementary school. I served as the president when I was in the fourth grade. I began communicating with the teacher by giving her suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly and conveyed her words to her friends as well. Through this, I was able to create a good atmosphere in my class and finish the school year safely. Based on these experiences, I learned the importance of communication, and I was able to improve my communication skills even further by serving as the chairman in the fifth, sixth grade, and middle school. [8/128 Results Sharing the Goals] In 2014, I achieved better results by demonstrating the power of communication that I formed when I was young. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. As the leader in charge of training, I thought that the reason why I was not able to perform well was a problem with the training method. We had a daily meeting and set the goal of advancing to the finals, and changed the training method as follows. First, some of the team members were freshmen who had never played a real game. The training method, which was focused on basic skills, was changed to focus on the actual game to develop a sense of practice. Second, we conducted the survey by asking each team member about his or her deficiencies. Unlike the past, where all the team members used the same training method, the training method was divided by level to make up for the deficiencies. As a result, my skills and teamwork improved, and I scored eight out of 128 teams that exceeded my goal. [Performance of 1/22 through communication] In 2015, I had an experience of breaking through the competition ratio of 22:1 through communication. I participated in the LG Global Challenger Competition by forming a team with friends from the IT, electrical and electronic departments, and industrial engineering departments. However, I had difficulty in deciding on a topic because my interests were different due to different majors. I tried to decide on a topic in the following way. First, we had a daily meeting. We came to topics that matched everyone's major and shared opinions on which was practical and objective. We also listened to their opinions. Rather than deciding by myself as a leader, I set a common goal by listening to the opinions of my team members. Motivated by this, I came up with more ideas. Through this, I was able to decide on the theme of 'Asia Power Network through HVDC', which covers everyone's major. Several majors gathered to approach the topic from various perspectives. Based on the synergy effect, they prepared a practical and objective story, and passed the document screening through the competition ratio of 22:1. [Life of Communication] Based on these experiences, I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. I was able to achieve good results because of the good free speech and listening among my team members. After joining the company, Samsung Electronics will show good results not only through customer stories but also through communication with internal employees, Samsung Group affiliates, and related technology companies. The centerpiece of the CES in 2015 and 2016 was the IoT. In addition, the scale of IoT is increasing as the domestic IoT market is expected to reach KRW 17 trillion in 2020. As such, I think the growth of IoT is due to the interest of non-professionals and experts. [Smart Home System Development] Based on the interest in IoT, I have experience in developing smart home systems as graduation works. We implemented various smart home devices such as air conditioners, gas valves, lights, and refrigerators. We implemented smartphone apps to remotely control these smart home devices and increased the degree of completion, winning the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition. As such, the IoT field has become an area that not only experts but also non-professionals can easily access. Due to the low entry barrier to implementing technology, I think that interest and technology in IoT will improve. [Tizen of Open Strategy] Samsung also aims to expand the IoT ecosystem by utilizing Tizen. Samsung announced its open IoT strategy. It plans to create an era centered on Atik, IoT.js, and Tizen, and opened Tizen so that anyone can use it freely for free. I think this open strategy is a way to further activate Tizen. I have experience in various training sessions through Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi OS with Linux platform, open source 'Raspian' was a target without any difficulties. Whenever I didn't know or got stuck, I searched the internet and I was able to fix the problem by referring to posts with similar symptoms in different communities. Tizen would do the same.People interested in Tizen will gather to create a community, solve problems through communication and collaboration, and become a solid Tizen. Samsung will also be able to lead the IoT market by using Tizen, which has improved technology. I think it will be in the near future that all products using Tizen will be connected to IoT in 2020."
"I usually shop at department stores. However, as the world has become more digital and smart, it has become an era in which many people shop online. In the process, I was not happy with the tendency to buy high-quality, long-lasting products even if I bought one. However, Lotte was one company that clearly solved the problem in the middle. When I first accessed Lotte, the phrase ""department store"" first caught my eye. Literally, I had to shop directly at the department store, but it was comfortable to shop anytime, anywhere on my computer or smartphone. I want to make Lotte, which is precious to me, more convenient to people in the world and bring many benefits. ""The process based on integrity."" I was raised with the assumption that people should always be sincere. I used to attend classes after graduating from elementary, middle, and high schools, which are not much different from others, but among them, I can express that I am different from others and I can be proud of my superiority. Always faithful to the basic concept of time, and working in a sincere attitude anywhere, I have always had a reputation that is more than normal when I take classes in college, meet with basic people, or make promises. I also want to contribute to making Lotte a sincere company. As a newbie to ""Creativity in the Lab"", I have no experience in working in society, but while attending university, I entered a lab in return for the good wishes of my professor and served as an undergraduate research student. I helped and learned the research tasks of the graduate school seniors, and while watching the professor's research tasks from the side, I was in charge of the parts I could do and submitted works to various competitions. In the process, I was able to think more creatively by not just recognizing research as a task, but also working hard to use the results of the research in various fields, such as applying for a patent application."
"Growing up with the value of 'Let's do our best to the end', my biggest strength has become persistence. I felt that my skills improved and my confidence increased through the effort to review what I learned and devise new ways if there was a problem I didn't know because I liked math when I was a child. I knew that if I tried without giving up in this process, the sense of accomplishment would double, and I have believed that even if something difficult happens in my life, there must be a breakthrough. Sometimes this personality can be a disadvantage, but I think giving up before trying is missing another opportunity. I think it takes constant effort to maintain relationships between people. I have always tried to keep in touch first, feeling that if I keep in touch without contacting him because I am close to him, I can understand him. As a result, I have made friends and acquaintances who have been with him for a long time, and there are many precious people around me who can share memories. The company thinks that people and people come together to work for people. Moreover, IT companies think that people are property, and the relationship between people is the most important thing within them. I will work with the idea that the company does not just make money, but as a partner to meet people and achieve goals together. In the second semester of last year's fourth grade, I carried out a graduation project under the theme of improving the performance of the patent search system. However, I couldn't concentrate on the graduation project because the schedule overlapped with the final project of external education. As a result, all three items were evaluated as ""low"" in the interim evaluation, and the professor in charge recommended me to try again next semester. However, my team members and I analyzed the cause of the failure because we thought it would be regrettable if we gave up without trying properly. And if the means for the existing meeting were by messenger or phone, this time we met our team members in person and shared opinions. One of the reasons for the failure of the existing project was to make up for the difficulty of properly conveying each other's opinions through the wrong communication method. I received an A+ grade because I received ""awards"" in all the final evaluation and received first place among the seven teams. In fact, when I received a criticism in the interim evaluation, I would have received another ""low"" grade if I applied the wrong method and continued on because I lacked time. As I finished the graduation project, I gained confidence that I could achieve good results if I never gave up to achieve my goals in any crisis situation and performed my work carefully and accurately with flexible thinking. I took classes in various fields such as software, semiconductor, image processing, and communication in my department classes. I thought that the essential competency in all these fields was programming skills, and I gained basic knowledge by taking C, C++, data structure, and web programming classes. I felt the need for database knowledge in system development, so I took a database design course and learned how to collect, store, and utilize necessary data."
"I have enjoyed making things since I was young. My grandmother used to hold my hand every day and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school, but when I matched it, I made it so focused that the day went by. Before I knew it, I was a little away from such assembly toys, and drivers and soldering were in my hand. One hobby has become to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that my concentration and analysis skills that have been established since I was young are the result of finding errors in the source code or being able to sit in one place for a long time. I think that if you don't do what you're given, you'll be harmed by others or you'll become lazy. So my job is to try to do it to the end. When I get stuck in the middle of the process, I try to find another way to solve the problem and avoid harming others. This is my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try to do my best to get the work I'm given to. My Trip Map started with the idea that it would be nice to see where and what photos were taken on a map while traveling. With the development of smartphones, it has replaced the role of digital cameras and film cameras. We took advantage of this to collect location information based on the metadata of photos taken from our smartphones so that we could create marks and display photos on a map. Furthermore, we created a bulletin board so that users could share travel information with each other. While working on the project, there were some conflicts due to disagreements, but each time I tried to solve them with new ideas. It was a great opportunity to experience all roles, including creating user UI pages and connecting to the database. What I always have in my heart is ""Let's be professional."" The position of ""professional"" that should not be satisfied with a hobby or favorite job requires a great sense of responsibility. I want to become a professional in software development. Recently, through an academy on campus, we reorganized what we lacked in JAVA and databases. I learned how to create user forms using Swing and access Oracle databases using OJDBC. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to make myself more advanced by challenging new things by learning how to develop a web using HTML and JavaScript that I am new to."
"""Good Dexterity Bad Boy"" I've always loved making things since I was a child. My grandmother used to hold my hand and buy me a small prefabricated robot at a stationery store in front of elementary school every day, but when I matched it, I made it so focused that the day went by. Before I knew it, I was a little away from such an assembly toy, and finally I had a screwdriver and a solder in my hand. It has become a hobby to disassemble and assemble broken radios, speakers, toys, etc. at home, operate by a certain principle, and find the cause of the failure. I think that my ability to concentrate and analyze from an early age is the result of being able to find errors in source code or sit in one place for a long time. It will help the project progress by finding errors that others cannot see, and reducing the time to analyze and understand algorithms. ""Water droplet consistency penetrates rocks."" When I was a child, my father told me to do my job on my own. He said that if I didn't do what was given to me, I would be harmed by others or I would be lazy. So, from an early age, I have a personality that tries to do everything I do. When I get stuck in the middle of work, I try to find a different way and solve the problem, and I don't want to hurt others. This has become my strength, so I try to keep my promise to others, and I try my best to finish what is given to me. ""If you give up, you can't dream."" When I first started college, I was ashamed of myself for falling behind students who had learned in IT since high school, and after I was discharged from the military, I had a lot of fear of returning to school. However, since I decided to return to school because I couldn't give up my interest in IT, I focused on studying so that I wouldn't fall behind other students. When I was in second grade, I created a delivery food app for my school area and dreamed about my job as a software developer. It was a meaningful time to learn about harmony among my team members and the preparation process of the project while making a gym management program with them in third grade. In fourth grade, I received an overall education on Java through a security developer course based on a core structure that can be used directly in the practice implemented by the Hanbit Education Center to acquire insufficient programming knowledge, which gave me an opportunity to grow to the next level. When I first created the delivery app as a ""Result of Interest and Pride"" team project, it was amazing that students were interested in it. The more I became interested, the more I became attached and proud, and I decided to become a software developer. So I read, coded, and practiced software-related books and programming-related books in the library every day. With this consistency, I want to go on the path of a developer to fill in the gaps. In the book called ""The 10,000 Hour Law,"" if you work hard for a total of 10 years, you become an expert in a field. I want to be recognized as an expert and become a developer who can be helpful to someone."
""" To Infinity and Beyond "" In the first semester of my fourth year, I developed ""OOO,"" an application for lending and selling books, as a graduation project. I organized my home screen with the Tab, which I used to use comfortably, but I suffered from various errors due to the compatibility of textbooks and Android Studio versions, and the Tab's strictness, which slightly changed the composition of each version. In fact, even if it wasn't implemented properly, it was enough to just look at the process and solve it because it was a graduation project, but my team worked hard, had a meeting, decided to implement it in Button rather than Tab, and developed the application and enrolled in the Play Store. Some people say, ""Don't let it work,"" but sometimes I realized that it was important to find a solution in a different way than what you chose. As someone who is still in the process of learning, experiencing that you can do it in one way and another was an opportunity to realize the meaning of ""beyond my limits."" Like Buzz's famous line, he chanted ""To Infinity and Beyond."" "" A Person With Something in His Heart ""I happened to see an interview with a researcher at TmaxSoft while searching the Internet. Among the many contents in particular, the phrase ""bringing out something in your heart to TmaxSoft's soul"" is the most memorable. I grew up in an environment where I was not rich in materials, so I was used to enduring with many emotions and what I wanted to do for my parents and family in my heart from an early age. However, the attitude of the pure heart that I had at an early age has changed to the attitude of trying hard for anything now. Rather than being greedy for what I want, I have been able to devote my passion and efforts to do my best from what is currently given to me and what I have. I want to do my best to complete what I have in my heart with TmaxSoft through education. Rather than staying in place in a competitive landscape, I will contribute to the development of TmaxSoft by becoming a member who is thirsty for growth and development."
"I think it is consistent with the direction of the IBK system, which puts customers first. I have experience in working on projects to solve problems while listening to customers' concerns. By implementing new IT technologies and services that reflect reality, I was able to lead to the award. When I was working part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to see if the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and I developed a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that can keep the safety of a child who is alone at home. As a result, I won the Excellence Award in the Embedded SW Competition by developing services that meet customer and market needs. I think the direction is the same with me in that I value customers the most. The demand for the credit system will increase in the future as competition in the mid-interest loan market increases. I applied because I wanted to become a new employee who puts the happiness of customers first based on the credit system, which is the strength of the IBK system. I have experience of earning A+ grades while receiving perfect scores in the project through creative ideas. In the subject of the embedded computing system, I proceeded with the project using EV3, an automobile robot. Although he drives well, I chose ""unmanned parking"" as I remembered his mother calling his father because of parking in front of my house. It not only implemented the unmanned parking system but also implemented creative functions. I think creative is the ""shortcut to relieve the inconvenience."" In fact, when I parked directly in the dark at night, it was difficult to park because I couldn't see wheels. In order to solve this inconvenience, we installed LEDs next to wheels to create a convenient parking environment in which wheels are visible even in dark situations. By implementing a differentiated system based on creative ideas, I received a perfect score on the project, laying the foundation for a perfect A+ grade. After joining the company, I will develop a computer system that relieves customer inconvenience through creative ideas and become a new employee of A+. Accepting others' opinions, I scored in the quarterfinals for the first time ever. The tennis club did not perform well in national competitions for several years. We thought that the reason why we could not perform well was because of a problem with the training method, so we had a meeting and discussed the training method. However, there was a conflict between the two opinions, which is the 'actual battle-oriented training method' including myself, and another opinion, the 'basic skills first'. As the head of the training department, I accepted both opinions and changed the training method as follows. First, I added time to conduct customized training on a one-on-one basis with my seniors. Based on this, I filled in the parts that I lacked in basic skills. Second, I developed my sense of practice by playing actual games with various opponents. My skills have improved by learning basic skills and practical skills. As a result, I achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 teams. I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. As the chairman of the 4th grade, I informed the teacher about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and based on this, I was able to lead to a good atmosphere in the classroom. I further improved my communication skills by serving as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades. I participated in the OOO OOO OOO in 2015 and demonstrated my communication power. Due to my different majors from my team members, I had difficulty deciding on a topic because I had different interests. I was able to choose a topic that I could share with everyone through a week-long meeting while listening to my team members. I was able to pass the document screening by choosing a practical topic and breaking the competition ratio of 22:1. I think communication is an ""achievement."" Good communication has resulted in good results. My goal is to live a life of communication with others. After joining the company, I will show good results through stories from colleagues, related technology companies, and customers."
"I have grown by 'communicating' since I was in elementary school. When I was in 4th grade, I was the chairman and told my teachers about my friends' suggestions and complaints. The teacher took appropriate measures accordingly, and based on this, I was able to lead a good class atmosphere. I also served as the chairman in the 5th and 6th grades and further improved my communication skills. I participated in the OOOOOO competition in 2015 and showed my communication power. Due to my team members and other majors, I had difficulty choosing a topic because the fields of interest were different. I was able to select a topic that could harmonize with everyone's majors through a week-long meeting while listening to the team members. By choosing a practical topic, I was able to pass the document screening by breaking through a competition ratio of 22:1. I think the definition of communication is 'two-way traffic'. It has produced good results because of the good free speech and listening among the team members. I think Hyundai I'Park Mall also needs to communicate. If we have achieved good results by understanding the needs of customers and launching services for customers, I think both-way traffic with customers has been successful. After joining the company, we will show good results not only through customers, but also through communication with internal employees and related technology companies. My strength is 'friendliness'. I like to communicate with people because I am an extrovert. I have a personality that smiles a lot, so I was able to open my heart easily and get close to people quickly. Through this, I get to know my seniors, juniors, and colleagues, and I am imprinted as a fun and comfortable senior to my juniors. In addition, I was able to get a lot of service by being close to the owners of restaurants around the university and the ladies of the store. Based on this outgoing personality, I was able to develop my ability to empathize with the generation by listening to the words 'slick'. The downside is that I am meticulous in my daily life, and I tend to be unsatisfied with my work if I don't do it perfectly when I work. Due to the nature of the engineering department, which has many assignments for each subject, when a single assignment is completed completely, I submitted many other assignments without completing them as the deadline was numbered. To overcome these shortcomings, I prioritized my work and proceeded with what I could do quickly. By completing all the assignments and projects in all subjects, I was able to supplement my shortcomings by winning three scholarships. I will become a new employee who saves the strengths, complements the weaknesses, and demonstrates my abilities in the Hyundai I'Park Mall. I learned about the importance of 'advice' through the failure of the "" 1/3 failure"" contest. I participated in the OOOOOO in 2015. I passed the document screening, which was a competition ratio of 22:1, and I was ahead of the interview screening. However, since it was my first time attending the contest, I prepared for the interview only with my team members despite having no interview experience. I practiced without advice and advice from professors with a lot of knowledge and experience in their major, and senior citizens who had already succeeded in the contest. Because of the lack of this process, I was unable to grasp the strengths and weaknesses of the team, so I was inevitably less competitive than other teams. As a result, I failed the interview screening, which was a competition ratio of 3:1. ""Success of the award"" and ""Advice"" was engraved on it, which led to my victory. I worked on my graduation work in 2016. I had a meeting with the professor every week to discuss the team's direction. I could get advice on technical shortcomings and practical aspects. After the meeting, I was able to improve my completeness in terms of technical and practicality by correcting the shortcomings with my team members. As a result, I won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition and the President Award at the On-Campus Graduation Competition. I think the experience of working on a project to understand and solve customer concerns is consistent with the direction of Hyundai I'Park Mall, which puts customers first. When I was working part-time at the cram school, my main task was to answer the phone to ask whether the students arrived at the academy safely. Through this, I was able to understand the practical concerns of working mothers, and I developed a 'Smart Home for Working Moms' project that can keep the safety of a child who is alone at home, which is the biggest concern. As a result, we won the Excellence Award at the Embedded SW Competition by developing services that meet customer and market needs. I think this experience is consistent with the goal of Hyundai I'Park Mall to maximize customer value. I think the customers of the Hyundai I'Park Mall IT system are 'internal employees' and 'real customers'. After joining the company, I will maximize the value of my customers by practicing the following growth roadmap. In the first year of joining the company, I will help employees with their work. I will understand the overall system and immediately reflect the improvements to support efficient work. In the third year of joining the company, I will implement convenient customized services for customers. By developing an integrated membership service, we will increase customer loyalty and contribute to the happiness of our customers. Through cooperation with ""8/128 Success in Sharing Goals,"" I have achieved the quarterfinals for the first time ever. When there is a difficult time after joining the company, I will work with my team members to identify the cause and overcome the problem. When I was working in a tennis club, I did not have good results in the 'National Tennis Club Competition' for several years. Ahead of the competition, my members' confidence was lowered and I tried to put meaning into participation without a goal. As the guidance manager in charge of training, I thought the reason why I could not achieve good results was a problem with the training method. I had a weekly meeting with my club members to set my goal of advancing to the finals, and through feedback, I changed my training method as follows. First, it is 'experience'. With the existing training method, which focused on basic learning, it was not possible to develop a sense of practice. Therefore, as part of the training, we prepared for the actual competition by playing actual games with various opponents, and after the end of the competition, we spared no advice through feedback. Second, it is 'eye-level education.' Unlike the previous practice in which all the members applied the same training method, we divided the training method by level to make up for the shortcomings. In addition, we invited juniors who lacked skills and conducted customized training with seniors.He taught senior citizens' know-how and encouraged them to build their confidence. Lastly, it is 'voluntary.' I changed the training date from two weeks ago to three times a week one month ago. I thought consistency was more important than cramming. In addition, they were encouraged to participate three times a week on their own, thereby developing autonomy and responsibility. As a result, their skills and teamwork improved, and they were able to achieve the quarterfinals for the first time ever in a competition involving 128 university teams. Through this, I was able to feel the importance of cooperation. I will demonstrate these capabilities in the Hyundai I'Park Mall, where teamwork is important. After joining the company, I will join with my team members to find a solution when the result is not good or when there is something difficult to solve."
"I applied because I usually like Samsung products and experience its strong H/W and S/W, and wanted to develop S/W that was developed someday. I was very impressed that IT technology can be used as convergence with various products through presentations on Samsung's work environment since I was in college. As a result, I became interested in software development itself, and this aspiration became even hotter as I worked on several projects. I have such a dream that my S/W is received well among users and my image of Samsung is also positively reconsidered. I hope this recruitment will be a big step to grow after joining the company as an S/W developer of Samsung, and I hope that it will improve my mutual exchange and production skills when I participate in company projects. Computer lectures I learned in elementary school were very attractive in that I could handle everything with just the letters on the screen. I was not just attracted to it, but I dug deeper and obtained a word processor certificate. After that, I entered university with a faint dream after going through middle and high school, and even before I joined the military, I only thought vaguely about the future. I just studied my major with the thought that if I were good at school, I would be able to make it after graduation. Of course, I had no goals for what I would do in the future. However, the military gave me a break in my thoughts and at the same time allowed me to develop my hopes for the future. While studying TOEIC, I had the belief that I should be more enterprising while reading books in the library. At the same time, I became interested in design and began to create personal works. Furthermore, I transferred to computer engineering after discharge because I wanted to acquire engineering knowledge in accordance with the era of academic convergence. Without the military, I would have wandered without a future. Even though it was a long time of two years, I am grateful for helping me become a turning point in my life. After discharge, I studied harder and actively asked questions from my professor so that I could not find out what I did not know, and received a scholarship throughout the school year. I obtained certificates for computer graphics, web design, and information processing in order to know knowledge that I did not learn in school. I was interested in Japanese other than English, so I studied by myself and obtained JLPT N2. I also worked part-time on weekends at the city library for a year after I was discharged from the military as a library manager, and I learned how to respond to customers and think from customers' perspectives. For the past three years, I also worked as a hobby while producing album covers, gradually receiving orders from other musicians. Furthermore, I was able to develop speech expressing thoughts by joining a book club and participating in related events, and thanks to these efforts, I was able to go on a cultural tour in Spain with the support of the school when I graduated. Here is Samsung Electronics, which has been developing dreams through this process and will finally make them come true, right before me. As I have worked in an enterprising attitude without fear, I will become an employee who asks and learns more about it even after joining the company. ""Spreading the damage of ransomware and coping with it."" Ransomware, which has emerged since the 2010s, is growing into a dangerous virus all over the world. Korea is also not safe, so it is spreading through domestic websites starting in 2015. Recently, even ransomware that attacks companies has appeared, so it cannot be overlooked any longer. The characteristic of this virus is that it encrypts all the file extensions of images, documents, etc., and does not release them unless a certain amount of money is paid, but it is not clear whether even this is really released. Some analysts say that all this money is used to fund terrorism, but it is not reliable in the first place. The only remedy is to find a key to decrypt the encrypted file, but the problem is that since there are many types of ransomware, the solution is a long way off unless the developer intentionally discloses the key. After all, once encrypted, you can either delete it or keep it until the key is released. Why is this virus especially rampant? The reason is simple: money. There are people who see this virus as a new way of doing business that can be difficult to decipher unless they find the key, and make tracking difficult by using payment methods such as bitcoin. How scary this is when ransomware has even appeared, which lures the victim as a bait to release it if she infects another PC? We want a more reliable response here. Backup is the best approach, but you need to come up with a plan that can be done in the first place. To do this, we need to come up with legislation that requires strong punishment for ransomware, limits the use of S/Ws that are vulnerable to security such as flash, and, above all, strong investigative cooperation between countries. Since ransomware spreads across countries, not just in certain countries, it is necessary to ensure smooth communication and common provisions between countries so that there is no disruption in investigation."
"""Childhood Dream"" When I was in elementary school, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming at a computer academy run by my father. With the combination of English and text messages, I became very curious about the actual programs being executed. I have been fascinated by the fact that I can make what I want and have dreamed of majoring in computers. ""The will to turn the tables on the exam"" As soon as I was discharged from the military after becoming a college student, my father retired, and during this period of time, I was engaged in academic, part-time job, and consumption activities. I had a lot of greed for academics and connections, but one day felt too short for me to do everything at the same time. However, I thought that this was not a difficulty but a stage for an examination, and I had a firm will to ""solve what I planned today by today."" I used my notebook to record my schedule and finished my plans step by step so that I would not fall behind. As a result, I was able to achieve satisfactory grades through my passion for my studies, and I was able to complete two internship activities, a scholarship, and an oo youth employment academy education. In addition, in 2014, I was able to successfully complete various events such as festivals and soccer competitions while serving as the vice chairman of So-im. By experiencing overcoming hardships, I came to have the conviction, ""Let's not lose our laughter under any circumstances, and overcome it with sincerity and effort."" This conviction will be the driving force for me to continue to develop as a person in the modern world. I think that taking care of something small that others cannot think of leaves a greater impression than giving an impression with a material gift to others. The advantage of being ""small"" is that I can distinguish myself from others. I worked in the military as an important human resources administrative officer. At this time, what I thought was the most important was to stay connected throughout the course of work. First, I analyzed the behaviors of the company commander, the administrative supply officer, and the senior officials at the office and what kind of work style I like, and based on the analysis, I took care of the small things from behind. For example, when a guest came, he would immediately turn on the coffee pot, set aside essential things for the task, and call them in advance so that they would not wait for the dispatched vehicle, to anticipate what would happen next time and help or unknowledge the tasks in advance. Thus, when I was discharged from the military, the executives in the same office would stop me from discharging, saying that life after my discharge was terrible. As such, it is important to take care of the trivial things that people around you may take for granted in advance. Just as I have worked hard for the convenience of those around me in the military, I will try to become an employee who thinks and acts in advance so that customers and executives do not experience any inconvenience even after entering the modern world. ""Scared"" I was a skittish young man. It was the fear that I could be eliminated from the ever-changing society's trends and technologies. It was this tendency that arose from majoring in IT, which was exceptionally sensitive to change and trends. But rather, this fear was the driving force that kept me running. Not to fall behind, I made the following efforts. First, I tried to have a firm domain about my major in computers. To this end, I took various major skills such as Database, Web System, and Embedded System in my undergraduate course. In addition, through the training of the o Employment Academy, a project called 'Between Musicals and Theater' was carried out under the theme of performance reservation service using the Spring Framework. Finally, in order to confirm my knowledge in my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. Second, I tried to provide high-quality products through a QA (Qualification Guarantee) intern course of a company called o. While conducting QA on TrusZone, a network separation solution, I found bugs by conducting a Confirm Test and a Regression Test through TC. It wasn't just looking for bugs, it was trying to modify and manage TC according to the changed contents, and recommended it to the staff in charge to develop the product, and changed the program details. Of course, there were moments when this fear was more difficult and frustrating than others. However, I've tried without stopping to turn this fear into confidence. I developed CS Mind by experiencing a part-time job as an interviewer in the employment dimdol program conducted by oooo. In a two-day program with several booths at the Jangchung Gymnasium, I worked as an exit security guard and was in charge of bathroom guidance and human resources. When I was interviewing at several companies before, I thought that interviewers showed an image of the company, and based on that thought, I decided to give a good image to the interviewers. Also, the needs of the part-time employees were similar to what I thought, and I decided to satisfy the demands as much as possible. As the work began, I answered the interviewer's various questions with all my heart as much as possible, and prepared various refreshments to relieve tension. Also, when you leave, I tried to give you the most comfortable atmosphere by greeting with laughter. The person in charge of middle of work praised me for hiring a really good exit part-time job, and after the work was finished, I was asked if I could do it again. Afterwards, I was able to fully demonstrate my CS Mind skills by taking on an exit part-time job in a program held in Daejeon. Even after joining Hyundai Marine, we will become an employee who builds trust by forming intimacy with the people around us through laughter. ""With Free Riders as Partners"" Currently, university is experiencing problems due to free rides during group assignments. I also experienced this situation in team projects. It was when I was working on a team project in the creative engineering design course. We set and held meetings twice a week, and as the meetings progressed, one person began to show up as a free rider, often being late or not faithfully performing the shared roles.Eventually, there was a setback in the process, and the team members took over the role of free riders, and complaints about the uncooperative attitude of all team members began to grow. I thought about excluding this team member, but I thought that the team should be able to make up for each other's shortcomings, so I decided to stay together until the end. I thought that conversation was the only way to solve the heavy team atmosphere, so I had time to communicate. Through the company dinner, we talked about everyday things such as the team members' interests and hobbies. My friend was open-minded in a comfortable atmosphere, so he confessed his concerns that he could not understand the contents of the meeting due to lack of technology due to the first topic he was developing. I thought that the low participation rate was a problem for everyone who was not interested in the team members. This led me to learn the importance of communication in team projects. After that, I had regular communication time with my team members, and I was able to complete the project within the period through feedback between them. I will contribute my teamwork ability when conducting practical projects in the modern sea based on this experience. The sense of accomplishment that follows by challenging a new field from ""unfamiliar"" to ""familiar"" became an opportunity to increase my confidence. In my undergraduate years, I was unfamiliar with embedded systems because of the SW-oriented education curriculum. However, as an IT person, I felt the importance of experiencing various projects, so I took this as an opportunity and challenged the embedded system. The first emotion I felt while working on the input device project called ""Air Handle"" was ""unfamiliar"" itself. Rather than proceeding with the development at first, I tried to understand the circuit principle and sensor behavior of the Breadboard accurately. After that, I successfully completed the project by applying the algorithm I made on H/W, which was made based on the circuit principle that I have studied and implemented by converting the driver's handle motion into a range of values of gyro sensors. Watching the algorithm that was made after many trials and errors accurately control H/W, I felt proud. Following the unfamiliar first meeting between S/W and H/W, the challenge to embedded systems did not stop. It was to make unfamiliar challenges into familiar ones. We achieved new goals by completing projects such as ""smart RC cars"" equipped with automatic parking systems and remote control functions, and ""smart door locks"" that control doors from the outside. Based on this experience, I gained confidence that even if it is a challenge to an unfamiliar field, I can do it by constantly trying to familiarize myself with it, and that confidence will become a big weapon as an IT person. ""100% Persuasion for Change"" When I was an intern, I had a QA about TruthZone, a SW-HW fusion network separation solution. Once, I had to change the network test environment at the request of a customer. Although many changes were needed due to a large-scale change, there were many difficulties due to the lack of giving to network wires and equipment, perhaps due to the long-standing environment. Interns said that it was impossible to change everything, but I insisted that it should be changed 100%. He argued that it was not important because it does not seem important now, but for the convenience of our successor, he should change the whole thing while recording, and suggested two ways. 1. How to use the RackTables tool 2. How to give a physical cycle I thought that using this method would make it easier for someone other than us to change the environment in the future, and I succeeded in persuading my motives. I went back and forth to the server room, connected and canceled the line directly over the phone, and wrote the cycle and tool. As a result, we successfully built the test environment that the customer wanted. In addition, the environmental change that was requested later was also successful by referring to the tool and physical cycle. After the internship period was over, I was able to take over without difficulty through two things."
"[Have you ever taken death seriously?] ""When we found Jungwoo's remains, his lower body was gone."" This is what I heard in training class when I was nearing the end of the seven weeks of basic training courses in the marines. It was a vivid story of an officer who experienced the Yeonpyeong battle in person. As a trainee at the time, I thought that I could experience the same Marine Corps, the same field artillery. Without even thinking about death, the thought, 'If my life ends here, how will my life be evaluated?' became an opportunity to strengthen my strong will. Since then, I have lived a life like water flowing down. [I can do anything now. I'm not afraid] The experience of entering the abyss gave me the driving force to faithfully and enjoy everything in society. My major in computers was difficult enough to get A+ and A, and I got TOEIC OOO and TOEIC Speaking level O. In addition, I engaged in a number of activities during the two-year theater club, information security club activities, OO Electronics SST special internship selection group, and during the vacation, I took part in a number of activities during the year and a half after I was discharged from the military, including tutoring and mentoring in English. I have created opportunities for myself to remove my shyness, which used to be my weakness, and to build up social skills and diverse knowledge from all walks of life. [Korea Appraisal Board. The starting point of my life] I would like to emphasize that my sincere attitude and affection for the study that I have poured out for the past 15 years continues to this day. In addition, my goal is to become a person who can lead everyone by creating a good atmosphere and who I want to work with. And I would like to become one of the pillars of the Korea Appraisal Board, which contains my professional knowledge that I have honed in my head and my dedication to the development of the national economy."
"[Growing Up] I have a special 'passion' for my dream. At the computer academy my father ran, I saw students sitting in front of a computer and programming. With the letters on the screen, I became very curious about the actual programming. Since then, I have been attracted to programming and developed a dream of becoming a programmer. I always sat in the front row in class, answered the professor's questions actively, and asked questions confidently. As basic knowledge gradually accumulated, I studied with my juniors. I came running for my dream when I was young and I am ready to pour out my 'passion' once again. [Courtesy others if you want to grow up] These are the values of my life. This is the lesson of my high school, and I have been using it as a value since then. I didn't understand this from the beginning, but I tried to practice it as it is. First of all, I always started with a low attitude when I started learning. Even if it was something I knew, I actively participated in class and served the teachers in my mind, and I found myself developing according to the teacher's teaching. I also began to serve my friends. In order to fix my shortcomings through my friend's strengths, I served my friend and made many people naturally by overcoming my shortcomings. Since then, I have become a value in my life, and when I start a new job or meet people, I am not proud of myself, and I started from a low attitude serving a big person, and I always got good results. I also want to show myself to start with a low attitude and grow more and more at TmaxSoft. [Capacity] In order to create strengths in the IT field, I have prepared two competencies with passion. First, I was faithful as a computer major. Among the various competencies that members of S/W developer must have, I thought that the most important was the basic IT competency. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as Embedded System, Database, and C. Java. Through this, I developed a real-time parking management system using Java and Database and applied my major skills as development. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy training conducted by the Korea Database Development Institute, we completed training on Web, Java, and DB, and proceeded with a project called 'Between Musical and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of the major, I had time to review the major I learned while obtaining an information processing technology certificate. Second, in order to learn a practical sense, I worked on a QA intern at a company called AhnLab and developed my quality improvement ability. Working in the QA team of OO, we conducted S/W QA tests on TruthZone, a network separation solution, and wanted to provide high-quality services. Through testing, we directly found issues and managed and improved them by using a tool called BugTrack. In addition, we directly added, modified, and deleted TC (TestCase) on new issues and developed the ability to provide the highest quality software to customers. [Strong and Shortcomings] It was essential to serve in the military as an administrative soldier and handle various tasks due to the nature of my work. I was ordered to do many things, but as I relied only on my memory, I found my shortcomings that I sometimes forgot things. While thinking about how I could remember everything, I decided to write it down in a diary and prioritize it to get things done. As I handled things according to the priorities organized in this way, the accuracy of my work improved and the efficiency of my work increased. As a result, I was able to handle bigger tasks and gained expertise in my work. Prioritizing the records and records that I started to fix my shortcomings has gradually become a strength and part of my life. Even when I am engaged in various activities after discharge, I always keep a diary, record it, rank it, and manage my work efficiently, and manage time and work. I will record everything and show you how I grow with expertise in tasks to take on, learning and solving important tasks step by step. [Hobby Activities] I relieve stress mainly through sports activities. First, I control my stress by taking a 2:30-minute round trip by bicycle using the Han River. When I ride a bike along the Han River, the stuffy inside is relieved through the cool wind, and I manage my mind by thinking to myself. Bicycle riding is a way to relieve stress by making up for the inability to exercise due to many things and keeping the body and mind healthy. I also enjoy watching the baseball team that I have liked since I was young. Every year, I join as a paid member and have a sense of belonging and support to relieve stress. We discuss the results of the game with the same fans through SNS, and we are friends beyond the same club members who we met in an online club, and communicate with the same meaning. When I visit the stadium in person, I scream with my friends who went with me in one heart to build friendships and relieve stress through support. [Club Activity] Since I was a freshman in the university, I have belonged to the 'Farmers' group, a small group within the undergraduate school. Before joining the military, Somoim had many students due to active exchanges between seniors and juniors, and I did more activities than other Somoim. After returning to school after the military, the status of Somoim has changed a lot from before. Not only were there no exchanges between seniors and juniors, but the number of active students has decreased a lot. First, to recognize the problem, we independently held a countermeasure meeting between the motives. The problem was that there was less time to meet each other. In order to overcome the problem, I first contacted my seniors and juniors, and took some time to spread my argument even if we were busy. He argued, 'Many seniors helped us until we were here. We should give back to our juniors as much as we received from them!'The seniors and juniors thought the same thing and knew the problems, but were told that they were busy and had no leading people, so they couldn't put them into practice, so I decided to take the lead. In order to spend time with the juniors, I conducted the study in two ways: an academic section, a birthday party, and a picnic. As a result, it naturally converged between the seniors and juniors, and the honor of the past was restored. I was recognized for a lot of my achievements in that I began to revitalize So-im independently. I felt that anything could be accomplished by working with people with one mind and realized the importance of my colleagues. I also felt that any conflict situation could be resolved through meaningful dialogue. [Motivation for application and Aspiration after joining the company] I have attended the CES 2013 in Las Vegas, the United States. I have experienced new IT technologies from world-class companies at the world's largest electronics exhibition. The fact that IT technology can be applied to people's lives in such a variety of ways made my heart race. If I am not satisfied with my current performance and do not improve, I will lose my competitiveness over time and feel that I will be eliminated at the same time. TmaxSoft is not satisfied with its current solution, does not dwell on past failures, and is trying various challenges with the goal of localizing the operating system. I applied because I thought that TmaxSoft was like a company award. After joining the company, I will constantly work hard with the goal of surviving the global IT market that is more severe than pride and leading the IT industry. First of all, I will absorb the work of the department I will work in quickly and accurately. In addition, I will constantly understand and understand the trend of IT technology trends and incorporate new technologies into existing IT technologies so that I can become a talented person who strives and develops for better IT technologies. Finally, I want to make the products I made to make the hearts of another Korean IT student."
"People can experience new experiences and beginnings through transportation such as buses and airplanes, or experience a break-up. The high-quality service I received from the reservation system, the airport, and the cabin staff while using Asiana Airlines when traveling to the U.S. with excitement on my first overseas trip amplified the excitement I had. I think it is important to provide high-quality services so that people who start anew do not experience any inconvenience to sadness. Asiana IDT is striving to provide smooth IT services by providing services for customers and flight services for employees in transportation-related businesses such as aviation and buses. I felt human in Asiana IDT's business and was attracted to it. I applied because I wanted to create more added value and return the kindness I received from Asiana, which made me even more excited with the service I received, based on my major IT. After joining the company, I will try to survive in the harsh global IT market rather than settling down thinking that I have become one of the best companies. I think the first thing I have to do is to learn and understand my part. I will try to absorb the work quickly and accurately enough that I am proud to be the king of knowledge in my part. Also, since not all parts of the company can be achieved by the performance of the part alone, I will also understand the overall process within the company. Furthermore, I will have a long-term goal of understanding and familiarizing myself with the flow of new IT technology trends. I think that I can handle my tasks more efficiently when I have knowledge in various fields in the software market. I will try to become a talented person who can look forward to the future by providing better IT services by incorporating new technologies into existing IT services. In addition, I will develop my current information processing technician license into an information management technician license, and I will also achieve my own growth. I think that people who can apply to a wide range of fields by looking at the whole thing can grow bigger than those who are good in one field. In the system development and operation job of Asiana IDT, I supported the IT sector because I thought that I could build up my skills by looking deeply through various IT-related jobs. Among the various competencies that members of IT must have, I thought that the most important thing was the basic IT competency, so I wanted to have a firm domain for my major in computers. Through my undergraduate program, I took various major skills that I thought were basic, such as embedded systems, databases, and C. Java. In addition, through the DB Employment Academy training conducted by ****, I completed education on the web, Java, and DB, and conducted a project called 'Between Musicals and Theater' under the theme of performance reservation service. In order to confirm my knowledge of my major, I had time to review my major I learned while obtaining an information processing technician license. During my undergraduate years, I had a lot of fear about embedded systems that used a lot of H/W, but I felt the need for experience in various types of projects and challenged them. While working on a project called 'Air Handle', I studied to understand the circuit principles and sensor behavior of the Breadboard rather than recklessly developing it. After that, the algorithm was completed by converting the value of the gyro sensor, an algorithm that recognizes the driver's handle motion, which was the core point of the project, into a range. I successfully completed the project by applying the algorithm I created on top of H/W. Then, I never stopped the challenge to change the unfamiliarity with the embedded system into familiarity. I completed projects such as 'Smart RC Car' with automatic parking system, remote control function, and 'Smart Door Lock' that controls the door. Based on this experience, I gained the confidence that even if it is a challenge to an unfamiliar field, I can do it by constantly trying to make it familiar. At the time of my QA intern at a company called AhnLab, I was in charge of network separation solution. In the beginning, when things were not familiar with them, the work was not easy in a tight schedule. As the deadline for regular testing was approaching, there was one unexpected bug. In the process of repeating copy and paste as a joke, files that should not be moved became copied. Although I sensed that it was a major issue, I found a bug that was not in the Test Case, and I also felt anxious about the overtime and workload that was to come. However, I reported to a tool called BugTrack, recalling my initial intention to make it the best quality solution. The issue caused the version to roll back and lost time, but I felt a sense of accomplishment that I found Major issues and reflected on myself, who was afraid of working overtime. I was proud to think that I contributed to the development of myself, my team, and the program I was in charge of, and I felt the importance of honesty."
"I live a life of Dori and loyalty. I have always tried to keep my faith in others under any circumstances. So, there were always a lot of people around me, and even if it was a trivial meeting, I valued those meetings as important. During the summer vacation of high school, one of my friends and I went on a trip across the country by bike for two months, packed only basic cooking utensils and tents. At that time, I couldn't afford it financially and didn't have much to eat. That's how I traveled, and through that trip, I made friends in each region, and through those friends, I received help with sleeping and eating, and I still keep in touch with each other to return my help. In addition, I had a meeting while playing games online, and I met people who worked in various fields within the meeting, and I have been close to each other for over 10 years. I have had various experiences through such diverse connections. My strength is that I do my best in what is given, look at the people around me, and reflect on myself. And I have been actively socializing, and I have served as an undergraduate officer and representative for three consecutive years in my college life, and I have served as the president of three clubs. I have been working hard with a sense of responsibility and leadership with the concept that ""What is good for others is what is good for yourself."" Also, when it comes to work, I never roughly do my best, and I always do my best. In addition, I have made ceaseless efforts to achieve a higher level of completion in my work. It was a lot of experience, especially when I was working as a startup club. While participating in the competition through the club, I won the grand prize, and such things as ideas and presentation skills of excellent clubs or social workers teams at other universities became good experiences for me. In addition, I have had good social experiences through practical training and the national ICT internship system since I was a third grader. I hope that everyone will have a stable and good job and personal development. And I hope that I will start the first step in my social life in an excellent company that can further develop my abilities. That's why I applied for a job at NIT SERVICE Co., Ltd., which has the potential for many developments. Also, I am like a child now at work, but I applied to acquire many learning opportunities in it. Currently, I am not a talented person with much knowledge or practical skills, but I can confidently say that I have the growth potential to sublimate into a sense of mission as a person who is sincere and always works hard. If I join NIT SERVICE Co., Ltd., I will always strive to grow into an excellent person with various practical knowledge and skills. I am currently studying, and I plan to continue studying to improve my related work skills. I believe that the way to quickly adapt to all changes and gain an upper hand in the competition in the rapidly changing international community is to secure excellent human resources. I will become a talented person in your company who can become the subject of these changes and competition. I promise to value the necessary 'trust' in the organizational culture, consider others, and become a passionate and enterprising person who possesses both humanity and morality. The job I applied for is QA, which guarantees quality. The job is to detect errors by performing tests according to procedures using the process at NIT SERVICE. Ensure that the function is appropriate for the requirements and repeatedly test the basic unit functions of the output. In the service support and inquiry response work of Naver Pay/Store Farm API platform, technology is supported where Naver Pay and Sturopharm API are used. If you have any questions, respond to them. If a customer or company finds a problem while using it, QA will be conducted to find errors."
"I was born on Hangeul Day on Oct. 9. Born as the second of three brothers, I naturally learned how to respect my superiors and consider my subordinates. Thanks to my parents who had positive and bright energy, I was able to go through middle and high school without having a hard time. Seeing my parents working in the field with many difficulties, I promised to become a consistent and sincere person just like them who constantly and diligently work in one field even in difficult situations. I will become a sincere employee who gives off bright energy and does my best in my duties consistently. I have an open mind that is positive and respects diversity. I have an open mind that opens and accepts any possibilities. I am a person who constantly challenges myself with the idea that such positive energy can affect the people around me and do it even in difficult situations. I also treat people with respect and consideration, as I believe that the most important thing in society is human relationships. I am responsible for every given task until the end and finish it meticulously. In order to make up for the slowdown in work due to my meticulous personality, I can find my own know-how and process things accurately and quickly In one class, I learned basic window phone production and Arduino production. It was a little unreasonable to learn two things in one class, but I did my best to attend the class. After the midterm exam, the professor in charge asked me to develop a window phone and produce Arduino as a project at the end of the semester. I was very embarrassed because I only tasted it. However, I did my best because I had to do it to finish the semester. It's not a big deal, but I wrote a report according to the instructions that the report should be written properly, and I finished the semester with the submission. I felt very heavy due to the unexpected end-of-semester project, but I didn't give up and worked to the end regardless of the result. No matter how unexpected a problem arises, I think it's up to my mind. I learned that if I decide I can do it and don't give up until the end, the consequences will follow. I will become a talented person who constantly challenges without giving up with the mind that I can do anything. As an IT-related major, I started programming based on C language and mainly dealt with object-oriented languages such as C++ and JAVA. When dealing with data using SAS, I learned how to produce statistics and My SQL. I can say that I have the necessary skills and experience to perform IT tasks. In addition, I have experience in producing an SOS application that can transmit and record locations using the GPS and recording functions of a smartphone using Android Studio as my graduation work. I always do my best in a given situation. After entering university, I set the goal of grade scholarship, listened carefully without missing lectures, reviewed the classes I lacked, and did my best in my studies. As a result, I got first place in the department in the first semester and received a scholarship. Receiving the scholarship made me more greedy and I worked harder in my studies. Although I was not first place, I have consistently received scholarships for four years and worked hard in my studies. I will become a talented person who meets the expectations of the IBK system, which sets the goal of becoming the best in the IBK system with its strengths of sincerity and consistency, and constantly strives to achieve the goal. As I entered the university as an IT-related department, I became interested in something that I did not have in my adolescence and thought about my career path. It is a company that values the work and teamwork that can save my major, demonstrates the best teamwork and gives trust to customers, and finally, it is a company that leads me to the best capacity for my job. It is a company that trusts and uses customers deeply, a company that creates value for the happiness of customers, and a company that can lead the best teamwork. I applied because it is a company that has a foothold for further growth in the future, actively supporting the improvement of employees' work, and investing for the future. Through constant self-innovation, I will become a necessary core talent of the IBK system by quickly adapting to the rapidly changing IT era, striving to improve my job performance for a given task, and obtaining related certificates."
"The most difficult question is, but I think I am an evaluator of the National Insurance Review. When it comes to caring for the people and improving the health of the people, I think thinking about others is the priority over me. I don't think I'll know if I'm fit or not if I work. Please print it out for me. I'll do my best. I have little competence, but I don't think what I can do is small. When the existing method becomes complicated or has a lot of work, I use software convenience to provide a simple and quick response method or coordinate opinions with the engineer and the required part. There were parts that were usually not accepted, but in the end, they accepted the opinion that we should develop it in an easy direction. My work was not remarkable because it was a project with several programmers and companies, but I was happy and rewarding when the work was completed well. I performed the work with the help of colleagues, related data from A, or the advice of related engineers. I coordinated or coordinated the differences in opinions or interests between developers, engineers, and A while carrying out the business of the company. Since there are numerous engineers at each stage, meetings are frequent, and the outcome is important in the final stage, so I express my opinion in advance on sensitive issues. I respect the other person's opinion because most of the work is subordinate to the system that listens to others' opinions, and if I have a new idea, I will express my opinion, so if a new idea is outstanding or a new item, it will be adopted. I also tried to collect the opinions of seniors and colleagues in areas that I did not know at all. So, I received a lot of help from my colleagues and received advice from my boss. If I thought it was unfair, I also offered a different opinion. I tend to talk about things in advance about how to do this, how should I do this, and it seems that there were many things that the senior should consider because it's a newbie's burdensome part because it's a job with a senior like this. He was a grateful senior."
"I have come to realize that even a small change in things can be revolutionized, not just by developing and inventing things that go against the times. I have come to pay attention to the fact that small changes can distract and lead many people. Data analysis can help us understand the current public's interest, and we must manage it effectively to increase the value of our data. At a time when the importance of data is increasing, I will perform my duties with the responsibility that I contribute to the health, convenience, and stability of society, rather than collecting and managing a large amount of data meaninglessly. With this mindset, I will work passionately with the goal of protecting the welfare and health of the public at the Public Officials Pension Service, where vast amounts of public data gather. It will be efficient and planned for the status of the public corporation and the welfare of the public, and I will not lose my generous attitude such as maintaining security and managing robust networks as it is a place where a lot of data is gathered. I have experience in carrying out projects with the aim of using IOT smart farm equipment in Capstone design. With the help of many data search and acquaintances, I was able to produce frames using profiles and motors, and I controlled the sensors using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The value for this was based on mysql, and the data was managed by establishing a database. Through trial and error, I learned that we must not lose our will, such as server construction, computer, Raspberry Pi, and mobile connection, and voice recognition technology that we did not expect when applying the first-time voice recognition technology. I think that the management of the public corporation's database is important in order to proceed with the work for pension and welfare. During the project, we will make sure that the work proceeds smoothly with the attitude and mindset of responding to errors. I think the information system is the most appropriate content among the contents I have been educated. The goal of this lecture was to learn the theory of basic network systems, databases, and management information systems. Introducing computer systems mainly for companies, I took practical environments and technology application cases during the training. Since I work to manage pensions and welfare, I think I need a lot of accounting and management knowledge even for computer workers. When I looked for the actual work arrangement, it was similar to what I expected. Economic knowledge is also essential to build and manage databases because it is a computer job that is deeply related to other tasks. When all these points were combined, I selected an information system among the training I received."
"It is a game derived from the world view of ""Haston"" World of Warcraft and is in the form of CCG. Unlike conventional card games, each card pack has a season expiration date, which enhances business continuously and provides users with a variety of gameplay. In particular, it has overcome the disadvantages of high satisfaction and boredom because it provides exotic attitudes such as ""speculation"" and ""tap shop struggle"". In addition, since both PC and mobile can play the game with the same interface, anyone can access it easily and quickly because there are no space and time constraints. ""Competition"" He was an ordinary child with nothing special since childhood. That's why I had a high sense of competition for my friends around me. I had a desire to do something that much when someone did something. The first start is competition for a cousin of a one-year-old boy, who turned 10 years old. When I listened to the sound of a prodigy by memorizing a thousand letters, I thought I could do it, so I started learning Chinese characters. While learning for the next four years, I felt a sense of accomplishment through the Chinese character test, and as a result, I received excellent grades in Chinese characters in middle and high school. During my school days, I started memorizing world maps as I competed with a friend who memorizes world geography, and I appeared in the Golden Bell as a specialty. Once again, when my friend's writing skills improved, I started reading essay writing and won an essay contest for the first time in my life. In the past and now, I am an ordinary person. However, I am full of aspirations to improve. In the future, I will continue to digest the strengths of people around me with my own and develop myself. There are many really important moments when playing games. The moment you beat Boss Monster in Reid, just before the game was decided, and you pushed your opponent with a trickery of your own accord... What if the game server explodes or a bug breaks out at this time? Just imagining it is terrible. Game QA plays a role in preventing the gamer's love for the game from cooling down by checking servers and systems countless times to prevent such a situation from occurring. To perform this role, stable server and system operation skills are required. After graduation, universities dealt with various server OSs, took information security-related lectures in vocational education, and improved equipment management and vulnerability inspection skills. I will become a game QA that responds quickly to any obstacles."
"""When I Like And Enjoy, Sometimes I'm Annoyed and Angry"" I think this is passionate to do something consistently that makes you like and enjoy it, and to have a combination of annoying and angry feelings. If you like something and enjoy it, someday you will get annoyed. It is because you run into limits, fail, or get frustrated. The will and effort to overcome these hardships is the definition of passion in my opinion. When I was in the second grade of middle school, I first learned how to play basketball from a friend. Friends who I first learned like me improved just by exercising together on a regular basis without much effort. But it was different for me. I was always halfway and behind. I didn't get the spotlight, and I was something I didn't need or needed. I was angry because I liked basketball more than anyone else and enjoyed it. So I practiced. I went to the basketball court in my apartment at 10 p.m. every evening and fried and threw it by myself. After more than six months of hard work, I reached a position where I could participate as the main player of the competition, and was recognized by my friends as well as skills that I am only good at. This experience has given me a sense of value that there is nothing I can't do if I have passion. I believe that anyone can do it no matter what the difficulties are. I had the experience of challenging programming with confidence while taking the 'Web Programming' course. At that time, I was not good at programming. I envied people who were much better than me, but I had a ambition that if I tried, there would be nothing I couldn't do. I personally learned by using books and internet lectures, and I carried out small projects and practiced at the same time. After hard work, I was able to proudly receive an A+, and that effort instilled my goal to become a Back-End developer. After achieving that goal, I have steadily studied on my own and have proudly passed the internship and development club. Although each failed once, I was able to achieve it by challenging with passion and confidence. After joining the company, you will face more adversity than you do now. However, I will become a developer of SoftSen who always grows with the confidence that there is nothing I can't do if I try hard and the passion I defined by myself as I have done so far. If the goal of 'growth and contribution through co-prosperity' is the same, I think I can contribute to the company actively as well as voluntary individual growth. I have a goal to become a Back-End developer. Furthermore, I want to build a career by moving on to the cloud and big data fields. In this respect, SoftSen decided that my goal was the same as mine. Currently, SoftSen provides web solutions based on cloud and big data. Therefore, I have confidence that I can grow quickly through leading learning because my goal and SoftSen's service are the same. For example, I have experienced voluntary efforts to build up the back-end development skills that I aimed for. I tried to improve my development skills by continuously refactoring my personal projects. Mainly, we perform refactoring in terms of improving code or applying newly learned technologies in an object-oriented manner. For example, I have experience repactoring the 'department bulletin board notification' in the order of Socket, JSP, Spring, ORM, RESTful API, module separation, and AWS. As such, I have tried to improve my development skills by applying various skills and knowledge learned through this experience to my actual code. Therefore, if the job goals are consistent, I think that of course, leading learning can lead to corporate performance naturally. Even after joining the company, I will not only simply organize the knowledge I learn, but I will also continue to grow as an S/W developer who can contribute to Softscene by improving my development skills by applying it to individual projects. In order to solve the problem of 'new article discrimination algorithm implemented with string', I constantly asked the question, ""Is there any other way to compensate for the exception?"" At first, I thought that there was no other way than what I implemented now. However, in order to break away from the existing thoughts, I constantly asked myself questions and suddenly popped up on the way home and was able to solve them. It would be nice if I could make it perfectly from the beginning, but most of them think that I have to go through 'refactoring'. Through this experience, I realized that continuous worries can provide clues to solving problems. I will always be responsible for my work and be reborn as a talented person who can solve problems through constant worries. #Problem 'How to determine new articles' There were two ways I thought of determining new articles. First, comparing the number of posts in Nth crawling with the number of posts in N+1th crawling. However, this method was unable to distinguish new posts because the number of posts would remain unchanged if the posts were deleted and added once between Nth and N+!th crawling. Second, comparing the number of posts and comparing URIs in the top posts. First, as a supplement to the method, even if the number of posts remains unchanged, if the URIs in the top posts are different, it is determined that a new post has been posted. In this case, similarly, if deletion and addition occur once within the crawling cycle, the URI values were the same because the posts have the same index, so we could not discriminate new posts. Comparing the titles of the top posts was an additional method, but we thought that this was not a fundamental solution because there was an exception that the title might be the same as the previous post in this case, and the code would get messy due to many variables. #Resolution We fixed the issue by using HashMap, Java's Collection. KEY of Map saved the URI of the post, VALUE saved the title of the post. The reason we used Map is that the URI of the post is guaranteed to be unique. Since the post request API usually uses the GET method, we focused on the feature that each post has a different query.As a result, we were able to identify a new article by finding the existing KEY, that is, the URI of the post, using the contentskey method between the existing data and the newly crawled data. We will fully understand the back-end that is the basis of the solution. Until now, we have been developing the back-end using Java and Spring Framework in private projects, interns, and development clubs. Therefore, I am confident that I can learn faster and fully utilize the Java web technology used in practice by bumping into each other. My weakness is that I have no experience related to big data and artificial intelligence. In order to turn my weaknesses into strengths, I will read the book 'Big Data Technology Learning as a Working Project' to get a sense of big data. After that, I will identify the big data-related technology stack used by SoftSEN and proceed with the personal project using the technology. AI will learn basic knowledge from deep learning to machine learning and proceed with projects that imitate the most basic AI programs. Through this, I will grow as a developer who can build up big data and artificial intelligence capabilities and develop core technologies. If it is clear what to do, no matter what difficulties there are in the process, it is my personality and strength to achieve them. For example, after setting a goal of becoming a Back-End developer, I experienced the adversity of being rejected by interns and development clubs in order to develop my Back-End skills. In order to overcome the hardships, I learned theories through books and internet lectures and proceeded with personal projects, developed my skills, and I was able to re-challenge and pass the examination with confidence. After joining the company, there are certainly many things I do not know, and I may be given assignments that are beyond the current level. However, I will become a developer who grows by achieving my goals for big data and artificial intelligence with the same challenging attitude as now."
"""The Best Value Partner"" There are three reasons why I applied for the Modern Information Technology. First, the vision of modern information technology to open a more convenient world with advanced technological skills and know-how is consistent with my vision. Second, it is the growth potential of modern information technology that supports domestic and international businesses with IT, such as the establishment of a next-generation system in the Vietnamese stock market and the establishment of an ATP signal system on the ground. Third, the human resources that modern information technology pursues are consistent with my values, which I am not afraid of failure and constantly strive for. To become a member of modern information technology, I took an applied SW engineer training course at OO Information Education Center, acquired various IT knowledge such as Java, JQuery, Oracle, and MyBatis, and gained practical experience by conducting projects to develop 'Free Video Lecture Site' and 'Secondhand Auction Site'. I will contribute to establishing modern information technology as The Best Value Partner by developing solutions that succeed L-Cloud based on my capabilities and core values of 5C. ""Collaboration, Growth DNA"" My growth DNA is 'collaboration'. When I was an undergraduate, I learned the power of collaboration by working on several team projects, and I have grown into a person who practices collaboration. For example, I have experience in collaborating in the 'In-school Course Registration System Improvement' project and obtaining results from the 7th to the 2nd in the final evaluation. The final goal of the project was to express the functions delivered by the improved system in UML such as use case, ERD, and DFD. To make matters worse, there was a team member who was left behind in a situation where a small number of people had to bear a large amount of work because the team member who was in charge of PM was excluded on the way due to early employment. Since I was a double major student, I was a team member who lacked basic knowledge of UML. I delivered reference materials, helped Q&A, and filled out the deficiencies of my team members. At first, it was somewhat difficult to learn unfamiliar concepts such as objects and attributes, but as a result of steadily helping me learn, I wrote DFD without difficulty. The task I was very overwhelming. However, when I first learned UML, I tried to understand the situation of the team member by recalling the old me, which was difficult, and I tried my best to recall that it was a common goal. This led everyone to participation without a single dropout. I think collaboration not only means that everyone works together to cooperate, but also that if there are colleagues who are struggling, they are willing to self-impose themselves and share and lead the difficulties. I will be a co-worker of modern information technology that creates team results by demonstrating my ability to collaborate, which is my main weapon in the IT industry, where collaboration is the main task. ""First Social Experience, OO Research"" The most memorable experience I had with interest and enthusiasm other than my studies was the OO research internship. It was my first social experience, so everything was unfamiliar and difficult, but through this experience, I learned the basic competencies necessary for working at a company, so it was the most memorable experience. My task was to develop an online survey page and manage the survey DB. While reviewing the survey DB conducted on the subject of 'children's education level according to whether parents are economically active or not', I found that the survey of respondents on parental leave was incorrectly classified as the economically active population. It occurred because the interviewer did not receive the purpose of the survey accurately, and we had to conduct an additional survey with little time left until the deadline. If smooth communication had taken place from the beginning, there would have been no such mistake. Since then, in order to minimize communication confusion, my intention has become to accurately communicate with the other party and to immediately take notes on what I have received. In addition, during my six-month internship, I learned an attitude that is trivial but should never be overlooked. For example, when I was handed a task, I realized that it was more important to ask questions immediately and accurately acquire the instructions and give them prompt and correct results, rather than try to reverse the task by myself if there was a blockage. I will show my communication skills, ability to perform tasks efficiently, and practical IT skills gained through experience in Korean research internship in modern information technology to the fullest. In this way, I will become a new employee who is good at modern information technology and wants to work with. ""Transfer convenience through creativity"" My strength is to make people's lives more convenient by adding creativity to the skills I gained through various projects. For example, I proposed a virtual manager account by demonstrating creativity in the ""Second-hand auction site development"" project. The goal of the project was to develop a used auction site where safe transactions are guaranteed by supplementing the limitations of used sites where disagreements arise during the pricing process, and where people can purchase the desired item at the desired price. I was in charge of linking membership DB such as membership registration, login, information modification, and withdrawal. For the safety transaction, which is the main focus of the development, I proposed a 'manager virtual account', a system in which the manager first manages the amount deposited by the buyer and then transfers the money to the seller after the buyer receives the item, to emphasize the difference from the existing used sites. As a result, it won first place in the creativity and convenience category among a total of eight teams. I think creativity is an essential element for developing technology that keeps up with the rapidly changing IT era. We are ready to support modern information technology that focuses on expanding cloud services and BI businesses through IT services based on creative thinking. ""Overcoming the 'urgent personality' by helping me,"" There are times when people around me feel burdened by my urgent personality. At the time of the project, I felt nervous as there were signs of being a little later than the schedule, and put an unexpected burden on my team members. Rather than just watching and getting nervous, I decided to help my team members after finishing my task quickly. ""Fourth Industrial Revolution, Cloud"" With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the IT trend that is emerging right now is ""cloud.""The cloud is at the core of the 4th Industrial Revolution, so it is called the cloud-based data revolution. Hyundai information technology is responding quickly to the 4th Industrial Revolution by providing integrated business solutions through the signing of MSP partnerships with Oracle Korea. My goal for the 10 years after joining the company is to participate in the response of modern information technology by developing cloud solutions that succeed L-Cloud. With this, I want to lay the foundation for Hyundai information technology to grow into a leader in the 4th Industrial Revolution. During my undergraduate years, I was working on the 'Smart Factory Design Plan Using Cloud Computing' project and discovered the limitations of SMEs that were unable to introduce smart factories due to lack of professional manpower and financing problems, and came up with an improvement plan using the cloud. I want to share the heart-rending work of actually building the designed system with modern information technology."
"This was when I participated in the Campus Patent Strategy Universiade. First, in order to understand the technology of the patent related to the technical equipment in question, the main components of the patent were analyzed and understood the technology. Then, based on the analysis, related patents and papers were found. I searched for the main components as keywords and found the core literature related to this patent. However, I looked for patent infringement products in Korea, but I couldn't find them, so I even reviewed the data sheets on the products of representative companies in the United States related to patents and found a product that is likely to infringe on this patent. And, judging that there is a possibility that this patent may be invalidated through the preceding literature, an avoidance design was suggested. As a result, I was able to obtain good results from the CEO award. I will become a new employee who is assigned to the IT department of Hanwha S&C in the position that I have achieved by challenging new things and eventually achieving them with my own attitude. Over the past six months, I have gained expertise and practical experience by participating in the on-campus 'Big Data Manager Course' conducted by the IT OOOO Association. I learned JAVA, JSP, Oracle, Hadoop, and R. I worked on a total of four projects on various topics and learned teamwork through communication. After that, I participated in the 'DA Design Contest' and modeled the data on the human resources management system of a company. While modeling data that meets the requirements of the company, I learned the practical skills of B2B, which are different from those of B2C. Based on this, I will become an essential human resource for sustainable growth as an IT leader. It was time to design an information search system as a graduation project. In the first evaluation among the progressive teams, our team, which was at the bottom of the evaluation in all areas, overcame difficulties and won the first place over all teams in the last final evaluation. We developed a system that enables users to search efficiently through pre-construction of technology classification and expansion of quality. I learned teamwork in the process of solving problems based on collaboration such as system design by taking each part. When I was in college, I was the team leader when I was working on a coffee vending machine design project. When I was working on this project, I tried to proceed with it by collecting everyone's opinions like a sponge. However, when I decided on the direction of progress including all opinions, the progress of the work was slowed down, so I couldn't complete the target design properly. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we will maintain the method of collecting opinions, but use a quick solution in reaching a consensus. The keyword of the IT industry is a challenge called 'CREATIVE' through the convergence of new technologies and existing fields. In addition, it is changing into an era of 'SMART' system and service that provides heat by adding one. With an interest in big data that will be considered more important in the future than today, I have developed related capabilities through the six-month 'Big Data Manager Course Training'. In addition, I designed an information retrieval system as a graduation project. The system was developed by the user through the algorithm through the pre-construction of the technology classification, the two-stage query expansion, similarity comparison, and text rank algorithm. This gave rise to the competence of SMART and CREATIVE. Companies are fiercely competing to take the lead in the market of the IoT, which is now and just around the corner. The IoT, which will be an important technology for the IT market and the overall industry, will be the goose that will produce a golden egg to create numerous values such as smart home services, self-driving cars, smart factories, etc. Hanwha S&C is striving to become a leader in the IoT market through an intelligent management system, a smart exhibition hall at COEX, etc. However, in order to lead the IoT market, Hanwha S&C needs to build its own infrastructure. I think that if we build our own infrastructure in preparation for the problems of the data surge that will come due to IoT problems in the future, we will be able to take a step ahead of other companies. To overcome this problem, there are ways to build infrastructure based on cloud computing, efficient storage, and big data analysis. It will be important for Hanwha S&C to take advantage of these factors in advance."

"I think the project ""PM specializing in risk management of production management"" started with business innovation. In order to generate profits for Samsung Electronics, I became the current Samsung Electronics by identifying, educating, and growing the merits of talented people. I want to be a risk management PM. I gained social experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and head hunting company for 4 years. While encountering IT technology from college to now, I think that the role I want to play and what I am good at are the role of ICT PM of Samsung Electronics. Although I lacked knowledge, I was able to expand my major competency in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting the professor and showing the design of the algorithm I think. These efforts enabled me to gain a holistic view of the IT industry, and I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by drawing CPU design by hand in the computer structure. When I was a graduate student, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge by specializing in vehicle communication networks, and I gained additional capabilities in algorithm modeling as I proceeded with the business. I will try to become a PM for Samsung Electronics what I learned through YouTube, books, libraries, colleagues, seniors and juniors. I will become a PM specializing in risk management at Samsung Electronics in the future. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, a Java book called ""Extreme Development beyond 20X Productivity,"" said that the difference in productivity is more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with Samsung Electronics in addition to synergy with technology workers. Based on the experience of programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by displaying pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in the graduate school. I have taken actions to solve algorithmic competition problems since I was a college student and laid the foundation for my computer knowledge through differential calculus and engineering certification for the continuous development of the computer field, which is the basis of my capabilities. In order to continuously modify and improve simulations, the graduate school is making efforts not to miss the details while studying algorithmic problem-solving strategy books, and has the ability to draw an algorithmic blueprint using a modeling language on background paper. I have worked part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, and I have realized the importance of conversations with people in various fields and the need for consideration. At universities and graduate schools, I was able to be reborn as caring seniors and juniors among my friends, and I was able to give positive motivation to everyone by saying that whenever I was working on a team project, I was always possible. A mockup is a life-sized model that is made for product testing. I consider myself a mockup for the development of Samsung Electronics. Just as the graduate school's goal was to produce the most suitable and perfect simulation results by continuously modifying simulation experiments repeatedly, I tried to become a talented person who can be used practically for Samsung Electronics. As a human OOO, not a student in the Department of Computer Engineering, I visited Samsung Delight Shop as if I were having a meal as I was interested in laptops and tablets among electronic devices. Recently, as I became more interested in ultra-books, I watched videos of disassembling and assembling mechanical parts directly from YouTube, and bought an SSD myself, and made it fun to assemble it to a netbook at home, and test its performance. Samsung Electronics' unique technology instills great passion and dreams not only in terms of technology but also in the younger generation by creating smartphones, smart TVs, and Tizen operating systems that Samsung Electronics actually releases. In addition, I think Samsung Electronics is lighting up all classes of society by personally practicing continuous social activities through cooperation with Samsung Electronics' volunteer team and volunteers from the Korean Red Cross. As a Samsung Electronics person, I want to show dreams to someone through technology and reveal all aspects of society, so I want to be a mockup of Samsung Electronics. ""Is it connected right?"" I believe that connection is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and as a result, large corporations began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growths and revolutions seem to be going in the good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. Take the Internet, which was considered the best in the world. Korea is the fastest. However, for the 5G that is emerging today, legislation and clear standards have not yet been properly designated, so it is common to follow international standards. Of course, it seems that there will be new winds and hopes in the industrial world due to measures such as creating its own OS like Samsung, but it is true that it is technically and practically lacking. What we need to look into here is the importance of connection. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies centered on the connection that Korea currently has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. Large corporations accept new technologies when acquiring venture companies, but they must carefully investigate and properly acquire new technologies. Mid-sized companies and SMEs should focus their management capabilities on IT and focus on fostering new human resources. Of course, these aspects are essential requirements for a company, regardless of the size of the company.In addition, I believe that Samsung Electronics should be a first mover or a leader in new technologies through connection. Samsung Electronics should develop the driving force that can lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond Korea's 4th industry. Future convergence talents will be needed, and I will connect them through production management."
"""Success and Failure Through Challenges"" I am either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my shortcomings, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I was curious as I participated in a college programming competition, and I developed logical sensitivity and passionate behavior. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication while writing proposals, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. As a Korean fiS, I will contribute to the research and development of information technology that can create new and certain profits in the Nth industry through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. When I was a freshman in college, I took an engineering certification course and acquired basic design and development capabilities to become a talented person in Korean fiS. I acquired basic knowledge such as physics and mathematics for efficient software design, and I wanted to design and drive the device myself with the team while taking design courses such as engineering design and system analysis and design, and I wanted to get opportunities for design jobs while improving existing design methods. I tried to find a point of contact through the pleasure of communicating with the other person, interest in new information technology, and the convergence of my computer engineering knowledge, and I gradually embodied these ideas to target my business with the goal of convergent IT WooriFISIN. Through cooperation learned in team project design and acquisition of algorithmic knowledge in engineering certification, I developed the engineering design competency cultivated to me. I have three actions. The first was to read more books and learn all the time because I still have a lot of things to lack. The second was that I should be interested in developing systems as a computer engineering student. Finally, I had some free time to read good humanities books, or researched the latest technologies in person during network time. ""Target-tailored development for perfect systems."" An impressive example of my recognition is the graduate school experience. In the second semester of graduate school, I developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. The safety service application that I developed was able to expand the research as it was used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that was actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication laboratory where I graduated. Recently, the importance of building and operating customized systems for consumers is increasing. So, as a member of the FIES, I investigated the trends in the existing FIES infrastructure for the use of information technology safely and efficiently, and I think that what I can do to solve the inconvenience of the FIES people is to supplement the system through the knowledge of computer structure. Until now, I have studied computer structure and Internet security and am making efforts to consider the safety and efficiency of the system. In addition, among the experiences I had with a new colleague, I had worked on an Android development project. I applied for the FIES because I think my capabilities will be the most necessary foundation for our performance as the number one researcher that customers love. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, among the ""Extreme Development beyond Productivity"" Java books, said that the difference in productivity varies more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with the FSIS as well as synergy with us. Based on my experience in programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by posting pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in the graduate school. ""There is no impossibility of endless effort."" My efforts include the ability to become a simple, overcoming talent. In college, I completed software-related algorithms, programming, object orientation, and computer structure, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms. Through my major in system analysis design, I have developed the ability to design big pictures of software using software programs. Although I lacked knowledge at first, I was able to expand my major in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting my professor and showing him the blueprint of the algorithm I think. These efforts gave me a holistic view of the IT industry, and I have acquired knowledge of the entire computer by hand drawing CPU design in the computer structure. My lifetime goal is to believe in myself to be able to say that I am confident in what I am capable of doing. When I was in the fourth grade of college and was in the midst of interest in majoring in computer engineering and IT, I focused on employment and graduate school, and aligned myself with IT. ""I will do it because it is what I can do."" What people usually say before starting a job is usually concluded that the job is difficult and difficult because of what it is like. At the same time, I often give others the sense of failure in advance because I will fail. Since I was young, I have lived with positive consideration with my family. My father manages scrap metal in a hardware store. Whenever I replace my father's errand, I talk to the elderly who carry scrap metal and pull the rear car together. Although I was about the same age as a middle school student, I had a habit of helping with my father. My mother, who worked in a restaurant for decades, always told me to develop consideration for my family and others. As a Korean F.I.S. person, I will deal with all situations positively with fun difficulties if there are difficulties and creative ease if there are any.I will work hard to develop the smart finance industry beyond the development of our own. It is positive that has made my achievement experience prosperous. I have gained achievement experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. As an intern, I had experience working on Android development projects with my creativity. It is about understanding the strengths of my team members. I think ""Is the connection right"" is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and accordingly, large companies began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growth and revolutions seem to be going in a good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual conditions of technologies centered on the connections that Korea has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. I think that our FIS should be a first mover, that is, a leading point, more than a follower through the development and operation of the financial industry. To control the model through programming, I had continuous conversations with my team members, and I was able to show the safe movement of the device through logical algorithm design while modifying the code repeatedly. When I was in college, I encountered security in the Internet security lab and experienced the convenience of applications through Android apps. Our FIS will increase the driving force to lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond the 4th industry in Korea."
"As an intern, I had the experience of using my membership to carry out an Android development project. I was attached to the team and first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology in Android, and I started the project development. However, my team member had a difficulty in that he had no experience in developing the technology called Android. Since all the strengths of the team members were different, I found an open-source project necessary to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study with the team members after work. In addition, for the success of the team project, I asked the development team for help to receive feedback on the source code and the speed of running the program. As a result, I completed the intern project and received praise while shaking hands with the intern president. I gained social experience in various fields by working in the lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. While conducting research on the radio wave model in my graduate thesis, I was immersed in the radio wave research. In addition, while studying the frequency usage status and wireless mobile communication technology such as mobile and vehicle in the wireless vehicle communication lab, I became interested in the status of Korean mobile communication. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive and led to good results. I got a good teamwork while working on the project in my university lab, and I was able to complete the first year of the project I was assigned to in graduate school. The future industry will be an era of convergence industries in which the gas facilities of the Korea Gas Stabilization Corporation and the gas industries of smart cars, mobile cars, medicine, and energy are merged. Rather than my own technological prowess, I will strive to develop the technological prowess of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation and expand the Korea Gas Safety Corporation's business that is more advanced for the satisfaction of the public at home and abroad. And what is important is also an important internal goal to become an executive of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation in the long run, planning and supervising the system so that I can lead the optimization of the smart ICT industrial environment. [Engineering Concerns and Exploration through Personality] The competencies that I feel most important while working on a project in the vehicle communication laboratory of the graduate school are personality such as positive attitude, correct personality, and smooth interpersonal relationships. I often worked with other teams, such as sharing test results with the Automotive Parts Research Institute, collaborating with research support teams, cooperating with other schools' laboratories, coordinating and developing work with researchers related to radio wave model projects that I have been in charge of since the second semester of graduate school. Since vehicle communication was the main field of study in graduate school, it was natural that knowledge, motivation, and major knowledge of wireless communication applied to vehicles were important, and I felt that the most important competency while actually taking charge of a project in the lab was personality, such as a positive attitude, correct personnel, and smooth interpersonal relationships. While working on a project with other teams, I studied on my own and learned what I did not know with a sense of ownership and enthusiasm from my seniors. With curiosity about the results of radio wave model simulation, I found and studied what I did not know by analyzing, modifying, and simulating the codes of my seniors. Through this process, I was able to inspire myself with constant motivation while maintaining passion and curiosity. The safety service application that I have developed has been able to expand my research by being used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that is being actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication laboratory where I graduated. Rather than focusing only on me, I will make an engineering contribution through cooperation for the public safety, which is a common goal as a Korea Gas Safety Corporation, by developing engineering design capabilities cultivated by me through cooperation through team project design subjects and basic computer knowledge through engineering certification. Through my experience, I will operate a complete quality product customized for customers through a preliminary inspection of the information system of the Korea Gas Safety Corporation, which is directly related to the convenience and safety of customers. [Target-tailored development for perfect quality products] In the second semester of graduate school, I developed a safety service application for accurate vehicle communication simulation using Java programming. In order to cooperate with the Korea Automotive Parts Research Institute, which was the main target for the application, and the laboratory using actual vehicles of other universities, we started the development by comparing dozens of parameters and requirements. Since the main purpose of the application was an application for safety services, I studied the safety services currently being studied in advance, and studied additional proposed or modified parameters in academic societies and papers, and continued to study what is the most important point of safety services and what kind of companies are the main target groups. For example, another university that conducted research together requested research assistance on safety services, and I shared the research contents on the forward collision prevention system and the emergency collision prevention system among the safety services that I had been continuously researching. As I shared the research, I began to see improvements in the safety service applications that I had previously developed in my lab. It was regrettable that the development intention was not clear and above all, the results of the research could not be clearly shown because the existing application was to receive values from the simulation and display them on the screen while the vehicle was stopped. Based on these improvements, I used Java programming to show on the screen the location coordinates of one's own car and another's vehicle, the vehicle speed, etc., which were values received from the network simulator, while also making additional improvements so that the vehicle's location can be seen moving together according to the moving coordinate values. These improvements allowed other teams to conduct research by using the safety service application developed in our lab, first conducting the simulation, locating the vehicle, and helping to efficiently design the simulation from the actual vehicle. [A leader in the safety industry] I graduated from the Department of Electronic Computer and Communication Engineering.I have personally been interested in the connection between the gas safety corporation's infrastructure and the integrated safety industry while leading radio wave model research with my graduation thesis. So I applied to the Korea Gas Safety Corporation, which is a leader in the next generation of gas safety technology. I was fascinated by algorithms for hardware and software when I was in college and graduate school, and I completed logical circuit design, algorithms, industrial mathematics, and discrete mathematics for logical algorithms. I designed the algorithm for the products that have already been released, and I later planned and operated an information system related to gas safety so that everyone can use gas more safely or live a convenient life through the system I designed."
"[Student-Motivation] After working part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, I realized the importance of talking with people in various fields and the need for consideration. At universities and graduate schools, I was able to be reborn as caring seniors and juniors among my friends, and I was able to positively motivate everyone by saying that I was always able to do team projects. [Result of Action] I had experience working on Android development projects with my membership. I was attached to the team and first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology on Android, and I started developing the project. However, my team member had a difficulty that they had no experience in developing Android technology. Since all the strengths of the team members were different, I found an open-source project needed to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study after work with them. Also, for the success of the team project, I was able to ask the development team for help and get feedback from the staff. As a result, I was praised when I shook hands with the intern. [Personality-Positive] It is the affirmation that has made my social experience prosperous. I have gained social experience in various fields by working in a lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive, and I have led to good results. I got a good teamwork while working on the project in my university lab, and I was able to complete the first year of the project I was assigned to in the graduate school and extend it to the second year. [Target-tailored development for perfect systems] The safety service application that I developed in my second semester of graduate school was used as a cornerstone of an application for safety services that has been actively studied both at home and abroad in the vehicle communication lab where I graduated, and I was able to expand my research. Recently, the importance of building and operating customized systems is increasing. I think what I can do to solve the inconvenience is to supplement the system through the knowledge of computer structure. While studying computer structure and Internet security, I am making efforts to consider the safety and efficiency of the system. [Motivation for application - Center of Eastern Finance] I applied to FIS System because I thought that FIS System was the safety net that managed the most important money for OO Group customers. While studying vehicle security in the lab, I was interested in financial security that was directly related to the customer's money, and my main motivation for application is to research and develop the core financial system in FIS System. [Up-Safety Application] When I was a university student, I encountered security in the Internet security lab and experienced the convenience of applications through the Android app. I also learned the applicability and scalability of security while taking an advanced security course in the graduate school lab. I thought that my job at FIS System was customized financial IT services. I will contribute my security research capabilities and application performance improvement capabilities to FIS System. [FIS-type talents] It is also important to become a FISIN who directly provides technical services to customers and enhances satisfaction. To this end, I will join FIS System and form a long-term team through continuous dialogue with seniors and colleagues. I will form a long-term team to speed up communication with customers and identify needs, and enhance the completeness of the project."
"[New Ideas Using Sensitivity and Carefulness] I am either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my shortcomings, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I became curious as I participated in a college programming competition, and I developed logical sensitivity and passion. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. As a researcher of Korean energy technology, I will contribute to the research and development of information technology that can generate new and certain profits in the N-cha industry in the future through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. When I was a freshman in college, I took an engineering certification course and acquired basic design and development capabilities to become a talented person at the Korea Institute of Energy Technology in the future. I acquired basic knowledge such as physics and mathematics for efficient software design, and I wanted to design and operate devices with the team while taking design courses such as engineering design, system analysis, and design. I tried to find a point of contact through the enjoyment of communicating with the other party, interest in new information technology, and the convergence of my computer engineering knowledge, and I targeted my business with the goal of becoming a researcher of convergent IT Korean energy technology. Through the cooperation I learned in the team project design and the acquisition of algorithmic knowledge in the engineering certification, I developed the engineering design competency cultivated for me. That's why I applied to the Korea Institute of Energy Technology because I believe that my ability to capture customer needs through communication with researchers and provide services accordingly will be the most necessary foundation for the Korea Institute of Energy Technology's actions as the number one researcher that customers love. I think that [Is the connection right] is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and as a result, large companies' roles were expanded, SMEs' workplaces were expanded, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. However, while these growth and revolutions seem to be going in a good direction in the world, it is true that there are no real results in Korea. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies centered on the connections that Korea has. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important. I think the Korea Institute of Energy Technology should be the first movers, or leaders, more than followers, through energy R&D. In order to control the model through programming, we had continuous conversations with our team members, and we were able to modify the code repeatedly and display safe movement of the device through logical algorithm design. The university's Internet Security Lab managed Windows and Ubuntu servers. He was in charge of user management and computer virus and physical security management in detail, and through this experience, the graduate school's lab managed file servers and integrated mail servers. For the accessibility and safety of management, all information was distributed and managed on hard disks, other computers, and the cloud, and anyone could access the information at any time. When I was a senior at university, I applied the concept of OTP to FTP application as a graduation thesis, and the graduate school developed a vehicle safety service application using Java. When I was in college, I encountered security in Internet security labs and experienced the convenience of applications through Android apps. The Korea Institute of Energy Technology will increase the driving force to lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond Korea's Fourth Industrial Revolution. [Extreme Development Beyond 20 Times] Bruce Ekel, the author of ""Thinking in Java"" among Java books, said that the difference in productivity is more than 20 times depending on whether the algorithm is used properly. I am making continuous efforts to equip myself with the capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software to create higher productivity through cooperation with Korean energy technology researchers as well as synergy with Korean energy technology researchers. Based on the experience of programming in the Linux development environment since college, I have continuously gained experience between hardware and software by displaying pictures on embedded equipment in the Linux environment in graduate school. In order to continue to develop in the field of computing, which is the basis of my capabilities, I have taken actions to solve algorithmic competition problems since college, and I have laid the foundation for computer knowledge through mathematics courses through differential calculus and engineering certification. When I was developing a calendar application in college, I doubted my team and I to find out the difference from existing applications. However, I collected open-source projects and characteristic analysis of existing applications for three days until 10 p.m. with my team members to make doubts a joint success. As a result, I was able to turn doubts into excellent grades such as A and improved trust with my team members. In order to continuously modify and improve simulations, the graduate school is making efforts not to miss the detailed basics while studying algorithm problem-solving strategy books, with the ability to draw algorithmic design using modeling languages on backpapers. To this end, I will join the Korea Institute of Energy Technology and form a long-term team through continuous conversations with seniors and colleagues. As a researcher of Korea Energy Technology, I would like to be a mock-up of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology because I want to show my dreams to someone through technological skills and reveal all parts of society. [There is no impossibility in endless efforts] My efforts include the ability to become a simple overcoming talent. In college, I completed software-related algorithms, programming, object orientation, and computer structure, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms.Through my major in system analysis design, I developed the ability to design the big picture of software using software programs. At first, I lacked knowledge, but I expanded my major in algorithms through the Internet and major books, and I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and broadly by visiting the professor and showing him the blueprint of the algorithm I think. These efforts gave me a holistic view of the IT industry, and I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by hand drawing CPU design in the computer structure. My lifetime goal is to believe in myself to say that I can do what I am confidently. When I was in the fourth year of college and was interested in my major in computer engineering and IT, I agonized over employment and graduate school. Professors and seniors and juniors around me worried that it would be difficult to adapt and even fail if I went to another graduate school. However, in my head, I had a strong belief that I could do it. When I was in my fourth year of college, I believed that I would be an information technician of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology for the next 10, 20 years and the rest of my life. For my short-term tasks such as going to graduate school and graduating, I researched wireless communication trends, which were my areas of interest, and now I am continuing my efforts as a computer while carrying out the Java Open Source project. When I was in graduate school, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge through professional research on vehicle communication networks, and as I proceeded with the business, I acquired additional capabilities in algorithm modeling. [I will do it because it is something I can do]. What people usually say before starting a job is usually concluded that the job is difficult and difficult because of what it is. At the same time, they often give others the sense of failure in advance because they will fail. Since I was a child, I have lived with positive consideration for my family. My father manages scrap metal in a hardware store. Every time I replaced my father's errands, I talked to the elderly who carried scrap metal and pulled a rear car with him. Although I was as young as a middle school student, I had a habit of helping along with him. My mother, who had worked in a restaurant for decades, always told me to develop consideration for my family and the other person. As a Korean energy technology researcher, I will respond positively to all situations with fun difficulties if there are difficulties and difficulties in the infrastructure for energy technology research. I will strive to develop the smart grid industry beyond the development of the Korea Institute of Energy Technology alone. It is positive that has made my achievement experience prosperous. I have gained achievement experience in various fields by working in the lab for 7 years at a university and graduate school, and part-timer at a coffee shop and headhunting company for 4 years. As an intern, I had experience working on an Android development project using my membership. Being attached to the team, I first suggested to two other intern members that they develop an app using GPS-related technology in Android, and I started developing the project. Since the strengths of the team members were all different, I found an open-source project necessary to carry out the development as a member of the team and conducted a self-study with the team members after work. While talking to people in various fields, the center of my conversation has always been positive, and I have led to good results. In the university lab, I got good teamwork by working on the project, and in the graduate school, I was able to complete the first year of the project I was in charge of and extend it to the second year."
"""Unstoppable Crisis for Development."" There were constant crises in my growth to become what I am today in Semes. First, I started with my parents. As the car center your father was running wasn't doing well, things went bad in his family, and eventually, he handed it over to someone else. My father became unemployed as a president. However, my father cheered up the way our family looked at it, and once again he bolstered to start working at a hardware store, and so far he has been running a wonderful hardware store. The second was when I was in college and contemplating computer science. I became interested in a field called computer science, and while I was on leave of absence, I thought about my major constantly as I gained social experience. I could imagine what I would be happy to do when I would later turn 40 or 50. But I say, I am committed to becoming a new employee of Semes and working with my colleagues to turn crises into opportunities and advance them. Bruce Ekel, the author of Thinking in Java, in his book ""Extreme Productivity Over 20 Times,"" says that depending on the proper use of the algorithm, productivity varies more than 20 times. I am continuously making efforts to equip myself with capabilities tailored to the convergence of hardware and software in order to create higher productivity through cooperation with Semes people. I have been interested in computer science since I was a college student by solving algorithmic competition problems for the continuous development of the computer field, which is the basis of my capabilities. I have worked part-time at coffee shops, headhunting companies, and family restaurants for four years since I was an adult, and I have realized the importance of talking with people in various fields and the need for consideration. It was the most meaningful activity to strengthen myself and constantly motivate myself while reading books about people I respect. ""New Ideas Using Sensitivity and Carefulness"" In my life, the incident began with the attack of weaknesses. My weaknesses are either oversensitive or overly cautious, and I am careful when speaking. To compensate for my weaknesses, I always act passionately with new goals. I have a habit of taking notes while carrying a ballpoint pen and notebook to check myself. When I was in college, I participated in a programming competition and became curious, and I developed logical sensitivity and passionate behavior. When I was in graduate school, I created ideas with researchers while exploring academic papers and overseas journals for new ideas related to vehicle communication while writing proposals, and I was able to contribute to ideas related to simulation and modeling. I used excessive sensitivity and prudence to come up with ideas in my head, but I was able to get quick problem-solving ideas through passionate brain activities and body movements. As a Semes person, I will contribute to the creation of new and certain profits in the semiconductor and display equipment industries through passionate brain activities and careful decisions. ""Division, harmony, flow of change"" As a college student, I liked to be active and exercise, and I worked as a soccer club and a coffee shop part-time in the lab. There were some difficulties while working at the same time as a lab activity and a part-time job for four years, but I had a great attachment, so I struggled with my body, but I acted responsibly. As the number of students in the lab increased to more than 30, individual responsibilities decreased, and problems arose as the number of students who did not participate increased. I suggested the division of labor to the lab students, and I tried to promote the importance of group activities such as general affairs, mentor mentee system, and cleaning, and efficiently carry out the activities in the lab. Due to my sensitive but passionate decision on laboratory activities, students actively participated and all worked in harmony. We will lead the change in global equipment quality competitiveness along with the Semes through proper division and harmony of our work. ""Is it connected properly?"" I believe that connection is the core of the semiconductor and display equipment industries. And I think connection is the core of the biggest social issue. The biggest example is the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the industry. Starting with smartphones, new terms such as ICT, big data, and connected cars poured out in the IT world, and accordingly, large companies began to expand their roles, SMEs began to expand their work, and new venture companies began to grow indiscriminately. Take the Internet, which was considered the best in the world. Korea is the fastest. However, for the 5G that is emerging, legislation and clear standards have not yet been properly designated, so it is common to follow international standards. Although it seems that there will be a new wind and hope in the industrial world as various measures have been taken, it is true that it is lacking technically and practically. What we need to look at here is the importance of connection. It is necessary to properly investigate the actual condition of the technologies that are centered on the connections currently in Korea. I think that the cooperation of companies is becoming the most important accordingly. Large companies accept new technologies when acquiring venture companies, but they must carefully examine how far they can go and acquire new technologies. Mid-sized companies and SMEs should focus their management capabilities on IT and focus on nurturing new human resources. Of course, these aspects are essential requirements for a company, regardless of its size. In addition, I think that Semes should be a first mover or a leader in new technologies through connection. Semes should build a driving force that can lead the Nth Industrial Revolution beyond the 4th industry in Korea. Future convergence talents like me will be needed at the center of it, and Semes should provide appropriate connections accordingly."
"[New Myth through Open Mind and Positive Thinking] In college, I completed algorithms, programming, object orientation, computer structure, etc. related to software, and additionally completed basic mathematics and physics for the efficiency of algorithms. Through my major in system analysis and design, I have developed the ability to design big pictures of software using software programs. I have continuously discovered possibilities through an open mind about learning, positive thoughts that I can do it, and endless efforts. Through the Internet and major books, I was able to expand my major competence in algorithms, and by visiting professors and showing them the design of algorithms I think, I was able to expand my knowledge deeply and widely. I was able to gain knowledge of algorithms, and in the computer structure, I acquired knowledge of the entire computer by drawing CPU design by hand. When I was in graduate school, I was able to realize the practicality of knowledge by professionally researching vehicle communication networks, how computer networks can be applied in real life, and I secured the ability to model algorithms while working on the project. [Action based on the thought of taking care of forests and trees] - Personality Keyword: 'Concrete Action.' The important point of my personality is the perspective of taking care of forests and trees. There are two important points of view when performing tasks. It is the same perspective as a forest looking at the whole, and the same perspective as a tree that can be divided in detail and continuously recognized and influenced. As a project researcher, I have practiced concrete actions through my strengths. To see the overall forest, I held meetings with master's researchers twice a week while conducting thesis seminars and watching open-source projects on the suitability and actual driving environment of the radio wave model, which were the goals of the project. In order to recognize the details and have a successful impact on the project results, the three masters involved in the project implementation were asked to perform the work of debugging their source codes themselves.

Before joining the company, if you have prepared for various colors of competency with your studies and various experiences, you will draw your dreams on the canvas of work by using various colors of competency. Just as the more diverse the colors, the more colorful the pictures become, I will try to draw dreams through various colors even after joining the company. [I will be an SE expert at E-Land Systems, which boasts the optimal distribution system] I think the key to E-Land's success based on its optimized system is its IT capabilities. I am confident that E-Land Systems, which is in charge of E-Land's enterprise-wide management through differentiated IT solutions and new technologies, is an optimized company that I can contribute to E-Land. I studied Green IT, Smart Grid, Big Data, and Beacon with great interest to understand the rapidly changing flow of the IT market. In particular, while working as an intern at a company whose main business is LTE communication solutions, I was able to directly experience home network technology by participating in a smart meter project that measures the power consumption of each household and transmits data to electric companies through LTE signals. In the future, we have supported to become an SE that can provide growth for E-Land Systems by creating an E-Land network solution that can be integrated into the store management and distribution sectors.

I have supported to become an SE that can provide growth of E-Land Systems by creating E-Land network solutions that can be applied to store management and distribution in the future. [The spirit of pioneering the creation of something out of nothing] To describe myself in one word, I am a person who practices something out of nothing. In other words, creating something out of nothing, focusing on what others have not come up with, and putting it into action in order to realize it. Since I was young, I used to draw pictures of future undersea cities, food, and fashion that others could not have imagined. Seeing my paintings, people around me were surprised and praised me for having unique ideas at the same time. I became interested in programming that allowed me to express my unique ideas freely as if I were drawing on canvas, and naturally went on to major in computer science. [Challenge 'first' through 'discrimination'] As a first step toward surprising the world with unique ideas, I started a fashion shopping mall called 'OO.'It was intended to provide the trust and convenience of customers through the rather unconventional operation method of 'pre-check and payment' which is differentiated from the operation method of the existing shopping mall called 'pre-payment and confirmation'. In addition, through the concept of personalized styling service, we tried to be competitive with existing shopping malls, and targeted niche markets by selecting men rather than women as our main customer base. Naturally, this became the first in the shopping mall industry to realize individualized O2O styling service for men, and returns and refunds have occurred at an average rate of 4% lower than competitors. Based on these results, we were able to get an opportunity to be selected as a nurturing start-up company for oo. [Leaving one's feet to find team members] We wanted to unite with people from various fields for the professional operation of the fashion shopping mall. We wanted to form a college student start-up team consisting of various majors such as business administration for the operation of shopping malls, fashion design department in charge of stylists and MDs, and media design department in charge of the design and design of UX/UI of service apps. In order to gather team members in each field, I ran on my feet, posted a talent recruitment poster on the bulletin board of the university student center, and posted a recruitment announcement on the online bulletin board of the major of various universities. After seeing the recruitment announcement, I was able to meet the students who contacted me in person to confirm the applicant's passion for starting a business. Through this, we were able to form passionate team members to lead OO. [Communication to achieve 'communication' through 'communication'] After the formation of the team, I tried to create better services through smooth communication with each team member. As the developer in charge of me, I did not pay attention only to development work, but talked a lot with the planner to understand the service function and the intention of planning, and discussed a lot of time with the designer for efficient UX/UI. Above all, I tried to improve the service process by grasping what inconveniences customers feel through conversations with stylists who actually face-to-face with customers and what difficulties the stylists felt in face-to-face with customers. E-Land Systems will take the lead in realizing the Digital Innovation that E-Land Systems dreams of by demonstrating the 'challenge', 'pioneering spirit' gained through start-ups, and 'communication ability' that can radiate synergy effects of team members."
